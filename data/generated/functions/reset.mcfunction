Now a procession of ants appeared,\\nfrom nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled\\nmanfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,\\nand lugged it straight up a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed\\nthe dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and\\nsaid, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your\\nchildren’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see \"}]","[{\"text\":\"about it—which\\ndid not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was\\ncredulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity\\nmore than once.

They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the\\ndistance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant \"}]","[{\"text\":\"current or a\\nslight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only\\ngratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge\\nbetween them and civilization.\\n\\nThey came back to camp wonderfully \"}]","[{\"text\":\"refreshed, glad-hearted, and\\nravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again.

They\\nparted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little\\nsteam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the\\ncurrent.

After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to\\nlearn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he \"}]","[{\"text\":\"would like to\\ntry, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them.

I’ll just _bet_ they will!”\\n\\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously\\nincreased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting\\nfountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues\\nfast enough to prevent an inundation; \"}]","[{\"text\":\"little overflowings down their\\nthroats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings\\nfollowed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,\\nnow. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and\\nmain. Joe said feebly:\\n\\n“I’ve lost my knife.

You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring.\\nNo, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”\\n\\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour.

But something informed him that if they had\\nhad any trouble they had got rid of it.\\n\\nThey were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare\\ntheirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well—something they ate\\nat dinner had disagreed with them.\\n\\nAbout midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"a brooding\\noppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys\\nhuddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of\\nthe fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was\\nstifling. They sat \"}]","[{\"text\":\"still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.\\nBeyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the\\nblackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that\\nvaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then \"}]","[{\"text\":\"vanished. By and by\\nanother came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came\\nsighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting\\nbreath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned\\nnight into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and\\ndistinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,\\nstartled faces, too. A deep peal of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"thunder went rolling and tumbling\\ndown the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A\\nsweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the\\nflaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops\\nright over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick\\ngloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.\\n\\n“Quick! boys, go \"}]","[{\"text\":\"for the tent!” exclaimed Tom.\\n\\nThey sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no\\ntwo plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through\\nthe trees, making everything sing as it went. One \"}]","[{\"text\":\"blinding flash after\\nanother came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching\\nrain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the\\nground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one\\nthey straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,\\nand streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something\\nto be grateful for. They could not \"}]","[{\"text\":\"talk, the old sail flapped so\\nfuriously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest\\nrose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its\\nfastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"others’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter\\nof a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its\\nhighest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed\\nin the skies, everything below stood \"}]","[{\"text\":\"out in cleancut and shadowless\\ndistinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the\\ndriving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on\\nthe other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight\\nand fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging\\nthunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,\\nand unspeakably appalling. The storm \"}]","[{\"text\":\"culminated in one matchless effort\\nthat seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to\\nthe treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one\\nand the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"out in.\\n\\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and\\nweaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The\\nboys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter\\nof their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were\\nnot under it when the catastrophe happened.\\n\\nEverything in camp was drenched, the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"campfire as well; for they were but\\nheedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against\\nrain.

They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had\\nbeen built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from\\nthe ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they\\npatiently wrought until, with shreds \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and bark gathered from the under\\nsides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they\\npiled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were\\ngladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their\\nmidnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep\\non, anywhere around.\\n\\nAs the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness \"}]","[{\"text\":\"came over\\nthem, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got\\nscorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After\\nthe meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once\\nmore. Tom saw the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as\\nhe could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or\\nanything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of\\ncheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new \"}]","[{\"text\":\"device.

There was no other\\nprocess that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished\\nthey had remained \"}]","[{\"text\":\"pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such\\nshow of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and\\ntook their whiff as it passed, in due form.\\n\\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"for they had\\ngained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without\\nhaving to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to\\nbe seriously uncomfortable.

It stands to reason.\\nBecuz you know that they don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s so. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"But anyway they don’t come around in the daytime, so\\nwhat’s the use of our being afeard?”\\n\\n“Well, all right. We’ll tackle the ha’nted house if you say so—but I\\nreckon it’s taking chances.”\\n\\nThey had started \"}]","[{\"text\":\"down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the\\nmoonlit valley below them stood the “ha’nted” house, utterly isolated,\\nits fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the\\nchimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"corner of the roof\\ncaved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit\\npast a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the\\ncircumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted\\nhouse a wide \"}]","[{\"text\":\"berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that\\nadorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come\\nfor their tools.

There’s some lucky days, maybe, but\\nFriday ain’t.”\\n\\n“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon _you_ was the first that found it\\nout, Huck.”\\n\\n“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"neither. I had a\\nrotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”\\n\\n“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s good, Huck. When they don’t fight it’s \"}]","[{\"text\":\"only a sign that\\nthere’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty\\nsharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do\\nyou know Robin Hood, Huck?”\\n\\n“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the\\nbest. He was a robber.”\\n\\n“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”\\n\\n“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and such like. But\\nhe never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em\\nperfectly square.”\\n\\n“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”\\n\\n“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"They ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in\\nEngland, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow\\nand plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”\\n\\n“What’s a _yew_ \"}]","[{\"text\":\"bow?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that\\ndime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll\\nplay Robin Hood—it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"“I’m agreed.”\\n\\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a\\nyearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the\\nmorrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows\\nof the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff\\nHill.\\n\\nOn Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their\\nlast hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were\\nso many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down\\nwithin six inches of it, and then \"}]","[{\"text\":\"somebody else had come along and\\nturned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this\\ntime, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling\\nthat they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\\n\\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and\\ngrisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,\\nand something so \"}]","[{\"text\":\"depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the\\nplace, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in.

They presently entered, softly, with quickened\\npulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,\\nand muscles tense \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and ready for instant retreat.\\n\\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the\\nplace a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own\\nboldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to \"}]","[{\"text\":\"look upstairs.\\nThis was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring\\neach other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their\\ntools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of\\ndecay. In one \"}]","[{\"text\":\"corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the\\npromise was a fraud—there was nothing in it.

He saw her\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”\\nwith a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in\\na peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint\\nthe next day for the long-promised \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and long-delayed picnic, and she\\nconsented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more\\nmoderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway\\nthe young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep\\nawake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s\\n“maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers\\nwith, next day; but he was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"disappointed. No signal came that night.\\n\\nMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and\\nrollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was\\nready for a start. It was not the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"custom for elderly people to mar the\\npicnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough\\nunder the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young\\ngentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main\\nstreet laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss\\nthe fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.\\nThatcher said to Becky, was:\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"“You’ll not get back till late.

And \"}]","[{\"text\":\"mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”\\n\\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\\n\\n“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll\\nclimb right up the hill and stop at \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have\\nice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be\\nawful glad to have us.”\\n\\n“Oh, that will be fun!”\\n\\nThen Becky reflected a moment and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"said:\\n\\n“But what will mamma say?”\\n\\n“How’ll she ever know?”\\n\\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\\n\\n“I reckon it’s \"}]","[{\"text\":\"wrong—but—”\\n\\n“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she\\nwants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if\\nshe’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"The Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and\\nTom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say\\nnothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to\\nTom that maybe Huck might come this \"}]","[{\"text\":\"very night and give the signal. The\\nthought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he\\ncould not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he\\ngive it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the\\nevening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined\\nto yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of\\nthe box of money another time that \"}]","[{\"text\":\"day.\\n\\nThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody\\nhollow and tied up.

Its massive oaken door stood\\nunbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled\\nby Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold \"}]","[{\"text\":\"sweat. It was\\nromantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out\\nupon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the\\nsituation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment\\na candle was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a\\nstruggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked\\ndown or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a\\nnew chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"procession went\\nfiling down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of\\nlights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of\\njunction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than\\neight or ten feet \"}]","[{\"text\":\"wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower\\ncrevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a\\nvast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again\\nand led nowhere.

Parties were able to elude\\neach other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the\\n“known” ground.\\n\\nBy-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth\\nof the cave, panting, hilarious, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"smeared from head to foot with tallow\\ndrippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of\\nthe day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking\\nno note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day’s\\nadventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory.

He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not\\nstop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his\\nattention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten\\no’clock came, and the noise of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"vehicles ceased, scattered lights began\\nto wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village\\nbetook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the\\nsilence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock came, and the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"tavern lights were\\nput out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long\\ntime, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?\\nWas there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley\\ndoor closed softly.

So they \"}]","[{\"text\":\"were going to remove the treasure.\\nWhy call Tom now? It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box\\nand never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow\\nthem; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the\\nmen, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough\\nahead not to be invisible.\\n\\nThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned \"}]","[{\"text\":\"to the left up\\na crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the\\npath that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took.

A\\ndeadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"thought was, to fly.

He began telling Julia of\\nsomething that had happened, or \"}]","[{\"text\":\"rather had failed to happen, on another\\nsweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago.\\n\\nIt was three or four months after they were married.

He went on reading:\\n\\n\\nChapter III\\nWar is Peace\\n\\nThe splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event\\nwhich could be and indeed was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"foreseen before the middle of the twentieth\\ncentury. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire\\nby the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and\\nOceania, were already effectively in being. The third, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Eastasia, only\\nemerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. The\\nfrontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, and\\nin others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general\\nthey follow \"}]","[{\"text\":\"geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern\\npart of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the Bering\\nStrait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the\\nBritish Isles, Australasia, and the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"southern portion of Africa. Eastasia,\\nsmaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier,\\ncomprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands\\nand a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at\\nwar, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. War, however, is no\\nlonger the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early\\ndecades of the twentieth century. It \"}]","[{\"text\":\"is a warfare of limited aims between\\ncombatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause\\nfor fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference.\\nThis is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"attitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous.\\nOn the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries,\\nand such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction\\nof whole populations to slavery, and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"reprisals against prisoners which\\nextend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal,\\nand, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy,\\nmeritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few\\ncasualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague\\nfrontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round\\nthe Floating Fortresses which guard \"}]","[{\"text\":\"strategic spots on the sea lanes. In\\nthe centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage\\nof consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may\\ncause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed its character. More\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of\\nimportance. Motives which were already present to some small extent in the\\ngreat wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and\\nare consciously recognized and acted \"}]","[{\"text\":\"upon.\\n\\nTo understand the nature of the present war--for in spite of the regrouping\\nwhich occurs every few years, it is always the same war--one must realize\\nin the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other\\ntwo in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences\\nare too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, Oceania\\nby the width of the Atlantic and the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity\\nand industriousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in\\na material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of\\nself-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of\\nprevious wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials\\nis no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three\\nsuper-states is so vast that it can \"}]","[{\"text\":\"obtain almost all the materials that\\nit needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct\\neconomic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of\\nthe super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville,\\nDarwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population\\nof the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions,\\nand of the northern ice-cap, that the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"three powers are constantly\\nstruggling. In practice no one power ever controls the whole of the\\ndisputed area.

Whichever\\npower controls equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, or\\nSouthern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes \"}]","[{\"text\":\"also of the bodies\\nof scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies.\\nThe inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status\\nof slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended\\nlike so much coal \"}]","[{\"text\":\"or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture\\nmore territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments,\\nto capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should be noted that\\nthe fighting never really moves \"}]","[{\"text\":\"beyond the edges of the disputed areas.\\nThe frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congo\\nand the northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the Indian\\nOcean and the Pacific are constantly being captured and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"recaptured by\\nOceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and\\nEastasia is never stable; round the Pole all three powers lay claim to\\nenormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored:\\nbut the balance of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"power always remains roughly even, and the territory\\nwhich forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate.\\nMoreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not\\nreally necessary to the world's economy. They add \"}]","[{\"text\":\"nothing to the wealth of\\nthe world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and\\nthe object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which\\nto wage another war. By their labour the slave populations allow the tempo\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"of continuous warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the\\nstructure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself,\\nwould not be essentially different.\\n\\nThe primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the principles of\\nDOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by\\nthe directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the\\nmachine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end\\nof the nineteenth \"}]","[{\"text\":\"century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of\\nconsumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when\\nfew human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not\\nurgent, and it might not have become so, even if no \"}]","[{\"text\":\"artificial processes\\nof destruction had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry,\\ndilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and\\nstill more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"that period looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the vision of\\na future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient--a\\nglittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete--was\\npart of the consciousness of nearly \"}]","[{\"text\":\"every literate person. Science and\\ntechnology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to\\nassume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly\\nbecause of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on\\nthe empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly\\nregimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it\\nwas fifty years ago. Certain backward \"}]","[{\"text\":\"areas have advanced, and various\\ndevices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage,\\nhave been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped,\\nand the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still\\nthere. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it\\nwas clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and\\ntherefore to a great extent for human \"}]","[{\"text\":\"inequality, had disappeared. If the\\nmachine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt,\\nilliteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations.\\nAnd in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"automatic process--by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible\\nnot to distribute--the machine did raise the living standards of the\\naverage human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at\\nthe end of the nineteenth and the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"beginning of the twentieth centuries.\\n\\nBut it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the\\ndestruction--indeed, in some sense was the destruction--of a hierarchical\\nsociety. In a world in which everyone worked short \"}]","[{\"text\":\"hours, had enough to\\neat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed\\na motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most\\nimportant form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no\\ndoubt, to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal\\npossessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while POWER\\nremained in the hands of a small \"}]","[{\"text\":\"privileged caste. But in practice such\\na society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were\\nenjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally\\nstupefied by poverty would become literate and would \"}]","[{\"text\":\"learn to think for\\nthemselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later\\nrealize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep\\nit away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a\\nbasis of poverty \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as\\nsome thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of\\ndoing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency\\ntowards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive \"}]","[{\"text\":\"throughout almost\\nthe whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially\\nbackward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated,\\ndirectly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals.\\n\\nNor was it a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by\\nrestricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during\\nthe final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy\\nof many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of cultivation,\\ncapital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were\\nprevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this,\\ntoo, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted\\nwere obviously \"}]","[{\"text\":\"unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was\\nhow to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real\\nwealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be\\ndistributed. And in practice the only \"}]","[{\"text\":\"way of achieving this was by\\ncontinuous warfare.\\n\\nThe essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives,\\nbut of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces,\\nor pouring into \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea,\\nmaterials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,\\nand hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are\\nnot actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"convenient way of\\nexpending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.\\nA Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that\\nwould build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as\\nobsolete, never \"}]","[{\"text\":\"having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with\\nfurther enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle\\nthe war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might\\nexist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In \"}]","[{\"text\":\"practice the needs\\nof the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is\\na chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on\\nas an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups\\nsomewhere near the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity\\nincreases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the\\ndistinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early\\ntwentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party \"}]","[{\"text\":\"lives an austere,\\nlaborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy\\nhis large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the\\nbetter quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three\\nservants, his \"}]","[{\"text\":\"private motor-car or helicopter--set him in a different world\\nfrom a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have\\na similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call\\n'the proles'. The social atmosphere \"}]","[{\"text\":\"is that of a besieged city, where the\\npossession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and\\npoverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and\\ntherefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.\\n\\nWar, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but\\naccomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would\\nbe quite simple to waste the surplus \"}]","[{\"text\":\"labour of the world by building\\ntemples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even\\nby producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But\\nthis would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"hierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses,\\nwhose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work,\\nbut the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is\\nexpected to be competent, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"industrious, and even intelligent within narrow\\nlimits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant\\nfanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic\\ntriumph. In other words it is necessary that he should \"}]","[{\"text\":\"have the mentality\\nappropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is\\nactually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does\\nnot matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is\\nthat a state of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which\\nthe Party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an\\natmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks\\none goes, the more marked it becomes. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"It is precisely in the Inner Party\\nthat war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his capacity\\nas an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party\\nto know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or\\nis being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such\\nknowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK. Meanwhile\\nno Inner Party member wavers for an \"}]","[{\"text\":\"instant in his mystical belief that\\nthe war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania\\nthe undisputed master of the entire world.\\n\\nAll members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"article of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more\\nand more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of\\npower, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search\\nfor new weapons continues \"}]","[{\"text\":\"unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining\\nactivities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any\\noutlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has\\nalmost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for \"}]","[{\"text\":\"'Science'. The\\nempirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of\\nthe past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of\\nIngsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products can\\nin some way be \"}]","[{\"text\":\"used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful\\narts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields are\\ncultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery. But\\nin matters of vital \"}]","[{\"text\":\"importance--meaning, in effect, war and police\\nespionage--the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least\\ntolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of\\nthe earth and to extinguish once and for all the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"possibility of independent\\nthought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is\\nconcerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another\\nhuman being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. In\\nso far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter.\\nThe scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor,\\nstudying with real ordinary \"}]","[{\"text\":\"minuteness the meaning of facial expressions,\\ngestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of\\ndrugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist,\\nphysicist, or biologist concerned only with such \"}]","[{\"text\":\"branches of his special\\nsubject as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories\\nof the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the\\nBrazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some are\\nconcerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise\\nlarger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more\\nand more impenetrable armour-plating; \"}]","[{\"text\":\"others search for new and deadlier\\ngases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities\\nas to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease\\ngerms immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under\\nthe water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship;\\nothers explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays\\nthrough lenses suspended thousands of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"kilometres away in space, or\\nproducing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at\\nthe earth's centre.\\n\\nBut none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none\\nof the three \"}]","[{\"text\":\"super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others.\\nWhat is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the\\natomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present\\nresearches are likely to discover. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Although the Party, according to its\\nhabit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as\\nearly as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about\\nten years later. At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, and\\nNorth America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all\\ncountries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized\\nsociety, and hence of their own \"}]","[{\"text\":\"power. Thereafter, although no formal\\nagreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three\\npowers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against\\nthe decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or\\nforty years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing\\nplanes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the\\nfragile movable battleship has given \"}]","[{\"text\":\"way to the almost unsinkable Floating\\nFortress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank, the\\nsubmarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand\\ngrenade are still in use. And in spite of the endless slaughters reported\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"in the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars,\\nin which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed\\nin a few weeks, have never been repeated.\\n\\nNone of the three super-states ever \"}]","[{\"text\":\"attempts any manoeuvre which involves\\nthe risk of serious defeat. When any large operation is undertaken, it is\\nusually a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all three\\npowers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and\\nwell-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely\\nencircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of\\nfriendship with that rival and remain \"}]","[{\"text\":\"on peaceful terms for so many years\\nas to lull suspicion to sleep.

This scheme, it\\nis hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization.\\nMoreover, no fighting ever occurs \"}]","[{\"text\":\"except in the disputed areas round the\\nEquator and the Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken.\\nThis explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the\\nsuper-states are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could \"}]","[{\"text\":\"easily conquer the\\nBritish Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the other\\nhand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine\\nor even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, followed on\\nall sides though \"}]","[{\"text\":\"never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were\\nto conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it\\nwould be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great\\nphysical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"about a hundred\\nmillion people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on\\nthe Oceanic level. The problem is the same for all three super-states.\\nIt is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no\\ncontact with \"}]","[{\"text\":\"foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners\\nand coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is always\\nregarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average\\ncitizen of Oceania never sets eyes on \"}]","[{\"text\":\"a citizen of either Eurasia or\\nEastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he\\nwere allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are\\ncreatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the\\nfear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might\\nevaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia,\\nor Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may \"}]","[{\"text\":\"change hands, the main frontiers must\\nnever be crossed by anything except bombs.\\n\\nUnder this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and\\nacted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"are very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called\\nIngsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is\\ncalled by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps\\nbetter rendered as Obliteration of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not\\nallowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but\\nhe is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and\\ncommon sense. Actually the three philosophies are barely \"}]","[{\"text\":\"distinguishable,\\nand the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all.\\nEverywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of\\nsemi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous\\nwarfare. It \"}]","[{\"text\":\"follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer\\none another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary,\\nso long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three\\nsheaves of corn. And, as usual, the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"ruling groups of all three powers are\\nsimultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives are\\ndedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that\\nthe war should continue everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"fact that there IS no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of\\nreality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of\\nthought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that\\nby becoming continuous war has \"}]","[{\"text\":\"fundamentally changed its character.\\n\\nIn past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or\\nlater came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In the\\npast, also, war was one of the main instruments by which \"}]","[{\"text\":\"human societies\\nwere kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried\\nto impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could\\nnot afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military\\nefficiency. So \"}]","[{\"text\":\"long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other\\nresult generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat\\nhad to be serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or\\nreligion, or ethics, or politics, two \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and two might make five, but when\\none was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficient\\nnations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for\\nefficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly\\naccurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history\\nbooks were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of\\nthe kind that is practised today \"}]","[{\"text\":\"would have been impossible. War was a\\nsure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned\\nit was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could be\\nwon or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous.\\nWhen war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity.\\nTechnical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or\\ndisregarded. As we have seen, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"researches that could be called scientific\\nare still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a\\nkind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important.\\nEfficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer \"}]","[{\"text\":\"needed. Nothing is\\nefficient in Oceania except the Thought Police. Since each of the three\\nsuper-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within\\nwhich almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised. Reality\\nonly exerts its \"}]","[{\"text\":\"pressure through the needs of everyday life--the need to\\neat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or\\nstepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. Between life and death,\\nand between physical pleasure and physical pain, there \"}]","[{\"text\":\"is still a\\ndistinction, but that is all. Cut off from contact with the outer world,\\nand with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar\\nspace, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down.\\nThe rulers of such \"}]","[{\"text\":\"a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars\\ncould not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving\\nto death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged\\nto remain at the same low level of military technique as \"}]","[{\"text\":\"their rivals; but\\nonce that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape\\nthey choose.\\n\\nThe war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is\\nmerely an imposture. It is like the battles between \"}]","[{\"text\":\"certain ruminant\\nanimals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of\\nhurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It\\neats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the\\nspecial mental \"}]","[{\"text\":\"atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. War, it will\\nbe seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups\\nof all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and\\ntherefore limit the destructiveness \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of war, did fight against one another,\\nand the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are\\nnot fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling\\ngroup against its own subjects, and the object of the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"war is not to make\\nor prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society\\nintact. The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading. It would\\nprobably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to\\nexist. The \"}]","[{\"text\":\"peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the\\nNeolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been\\nreplaced by something quite different.

From the point of view of\\nthe Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the\\nname of their masters.\\n\\nBy the late \"}]","[{\"text\":\"nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become\\nobvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers who\\ninterpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that\\ninequality was the unalterable law of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"human life.

The cyclical movement of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"history was now\\nintelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it\\nwas alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early\\nas the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become\\ntechnically \"}]","[{\"text\":\"possible. It was still true that men were not equal in their\\nnative talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that\\nfavoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real\\nneed for class distinctions or for \"}]","[{\"text\":\"large differences of wealth. In earlier\\nages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable.\\nInequality was the price of civilization. With the development of machine\\nproduction, however, the case was altered. Even if it \"}]","[{\"text\":\"was still necessary\\nfor human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary\\nfor them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, from\\nthe point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to\\nbe averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was\\nin fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of\\nan earthly paradise in which men \"}]","[{\"text\":\"should live together in a state of\\nbrotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human\\nimagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold\\neven on the groups who actually profited by each historical change. The\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"heirs of the French, English, and American revolutions had partly believed\\nin their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality\\nbefore the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be\\ninfluenced by them to some extent. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"But by the fourth decade of the\\ntwentieth century all the main currents of political thought were\\nauthoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the\\nmoment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the\\ngeneral hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which\\nhad been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years--imprisonment\\nwithout trial, the use of war \"}]","[{\"text\":\"prisoners as slaves, public executions,\\ntorture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation\\nof whole populations--not only became common again, but were tolerated\\nand even defended by people who considered themselves \"}]","[{\"text\":\"enlightened and\\nprogressive.\\n\\nIt was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and\\ncounter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals\\nemerged as fully worked-out political theories. But they \"}]","[{\"text\":\"had been\\nforeshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which\\nhad appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world\\nwhich would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What\\nkind of people \"}]","[{\"text\":\"would control this world had been equally obvious. The new\\naristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists,\\ntechnicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists,\\nteachers, journalists, and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"professional politicians. These people, whose\\norigins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the\\nworking class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of\\nmonopoly industry and centralized government. As \"}]","[{\"text\":\"compared with their\\nopposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by\\nluxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what\\nthey were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This last\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"difference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the\\ntyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling groups\\nwere always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to\\nleave loose ends everywhere, to \"}]","[{\"text\":\"regard only the overt act and to be\\nuninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church\\nof the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason\\nfor this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"citizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however,\\nmade it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio\\ncarried the process further. With the development of television, and\\nthe technical advance which made it \"}]","[{\"text\":\"possible to receive and transmit\\nsimultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every\\ncitizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching,\\ncould be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of\\ncommunication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only complete\\nobedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion\\non all subjects, now existed for the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"first time.\\n\\nAfter the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society\\nregrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High\\ngroup, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"was needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that the\\nonly secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege\\nare most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called\\n'abolition of private property' which \"}]","[{\"text\":\"took place in the middle years of\\nthe century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer\\nhands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a\\ngroup instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the\\nParty owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and\\ndisposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following the\\nRevolution it was able to step into \"}]","[{\"text\":\"this commanding position almost\\nunopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of\\ncollectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class\\nwere expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses,\\ntransport--everything had been taken away from them: and since these\\nthings were no longer private property, it followed that they must be\\npublic property. Ingsoc, which grew \"}]","[{\"text\":\"out of the earlier Socialist movement\\nand inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in\\nthe Socialist programme; with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand,\\nthat economic inequality has been made permanent.\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than\\nthis. There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power.\\nEither it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that\\nthe masses are stirred to revolt, or \"}]","[{\"text\":\"it allows a strong and discontented\\nMiddle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and\\nwillingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule\\nall four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which could\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately\\nthe determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself.\\n\\nAfter the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality\\ndisappeared. Each \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of the three powers which now divide the world is in\\nfact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow\\ndemographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert.\\nThe second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The \"}]","[{\"text\":\"masses never\\nrevolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are\\noppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of\\ncomparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed. The\\nrecurrent economic \"}]","[{\"text\":\"crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are\\nnot now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations\\ncan and do happen without having political results, because there is no\\nway in which discontent can become articulate. As for \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the problem of\\nover-production, which has been latent in our society since the development\\nof machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare\\n(see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the\\nnecessary pitch. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore,\\nthe only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able,\\nunder-employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and\\nscepticism in their own ranks.

In the year 1984\\nthere was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of\\ncommunication, either in speech or \"}]","[{\"text\":\"writing. The leading articles in\\n'The Times' were written in it, but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could\\nonly be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that Newspeak would\\nhave finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all\\nParty members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructions\\nmore and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and\\nembodied in the Ninth and Tenth \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was\\na provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic\\nformations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final,\\nperfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of the Dictionary,\\nthat we are concerned here.\\n\\nThe purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression\\nfor the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc,\\nbut to make all other modes of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"thought impossible. It was intended that\\nwhen Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten,\\na heretical thought--that is, a thought diverging from the principles of\\nIngsoc--should be literally unthinkable, at least so far \"}]","[{\"text\":\"as thought is\\ndependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and\\noften very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could\\nproperly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the\\npossibility of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly\\nby the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable\\nwords and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and\\nso far as possible of all secondary \"}]","[{\"text\":\"meanings whatever. To give a single\\nexample. The word FREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be\\nused in such statements as 'This dog is free from lice' or 'This field is\\nfree from weeds'. It could not be used in its old sense of 'politically\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"free' or 'intellectually free' since political and intellectual freedom no\\nlonger existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless.\\nQuite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction\\nof vocabulary was regarded as an end \"}]","[{\"text\":\"in itself, and no word that could be\\ndispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend\\nbut to DIMINISH the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly\\nassisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though\\nmany Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words,\\nwould be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak\\nwords were divided into three \"}]","[{\"text\":\"distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary,\\nthe B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary.\\nIt will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical\\npeculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"section devoted to\\nthe A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.\\n\\n\\nTHE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the\\nbusiness of everyday life--for such things as eating, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"drinking, working,\\nputting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles,\\ngardening, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of words\\nthat we already possess words like HIT, RUN, DOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE,\\nFIELD--but in \"}]","[{\"text\":\"comparison with the present-day English vocabulary their\\nnumber was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly\\ndefined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of\\nthem. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"this class was\\nsimply a staccato sound expressing ONE clearly understood concept. It\\nwould have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary\\npurposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was intended\\nonly to express \"}]","[{\"text\":\"simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete\\nobjects or physical actions.\\n\\nThe grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first of\\nthese was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very\\nabstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun,\\nadjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were\\nof the same root, there was never any \"}]","[{\"text\":\"variation, this rule of itself\\ninvolving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT, for\\nexample, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by THINK, which\\ndid duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention,\\nin other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning\\nwere not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently\\nsuppressed. There was, for example, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"no such word as CUT, its meaning being\\nsufficiently covered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed by\\nadding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -WISE. Thus\\nfor example, SPEEDFUL meant 'rapid' and SPEEDWISE meant \"}]","[{\"text\":\"'quickly'. Certain\\nof our present-day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK, SOFT,\\nwere retained, but their total number was very small. There was little\\nneed for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by\\nadding -FUL to a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained,\\nexcept for a very few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination was\\ninvariable. The word WELL, for example, was replaced by GOODWISE.\\n\\nIn addition, any \"}]","[{\"text\":\"word--this again applied in principle to every word in\\nthe language--could be negatived by adding the affix UN-, or could be\\nstrengthened by the affix PLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis,\\nDOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, for example, UNCOLD meant 'warm', \"}]","[{\"text\":\"while PLUSCOLD and\\nDOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, 'very cold' and 'superlatively cold'.\\nIt was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of\\nalmost any word by prepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-,\\netc. By such \"}]","[{\"text\":\"methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous\\ndiminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word GOOD, there was no\\nneed for such a word as BAD, since the required meaning was equally\\nwell--indeed, better--expressed by UNGOOD. All that was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"necessary, in any\\ncase where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide\\nwhich of them to suppress. DARK, for example, could be replaced by UNLIGHT,\\nor LIGHT by UNDARK, according to preference.\\n\\nThe second \"}]","[{\"text\":\"distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity.\\nSubject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions\\nfollowed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past\\nparticiple were the same and ended in \"}]","[{\"text\":\"-ED. The preterite of STEAL was\\nSTEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and so on throughout the\\nlanguage, all such forms as SWAM, GAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being\\nabolished. All plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case might be.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, LIFES. Comparison of\\nadjectives was invariably made by adding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST),\\nirregular forms and the MORE, MOST formation being suppressed.\\n\\nThe only classes \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly\\nwere the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the\\nauxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that\\nWHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the SHALL, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"SHOULD tenses had\\nbeen dropped, all their uses being covered by WILL and WOULD. There were\\nalso certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for\\nrapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable\\nto be incorrectly \"}]","[{\"text\":\"heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally\\ntherefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word\\nor an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt\\nchiefly in connexion with the B \"}]","[{\"text\":\"vocabulary. WHY so great an importance was\\nattached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.\\n\\n\\nTHE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been\\ndeliberately \"}]","[{\"text\":\"constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say,\\nwhich not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended\\nto impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without\\na full understanding of the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use\\nthese words correctly. In some cases they could be translated into\\nOldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually\\ndemanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of certain\\novertones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing\\nwhole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more\\naccurate and forcible than ordinary language.\\n\\nThe B words were \"}]","[{\"text\":\"in all cases compound words. [Compound words such as\\nSPEAKWRITE, were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were\\nmerely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.]\\nThey consisted of two or more words, or portions of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"words, welded together\\nin an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a\\nnoun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single\\nexample: the word GOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy', or, if\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"one chose to regard it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodox manner'. This\\ninflected as follows: noun-verb, GOODTHINK; past tense and past participle,\\nGOODTHINKED; present participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOODTHINKFUL;\\nadverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"GOODTHINKER.\\n\\nThe B words were not constructed on any etymological plan.

In the word CRIMETHINK (thoughtcrime),\\nfor instance, the THINK came second, whereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police)\\nit came first, and in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable.\\nBecause of the great difficulty in \"}]","[{\"text\":\"securing euphony, irregular formations\\nwere commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example,\\nthe adjective forms of MINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively,\\nMINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, simply \"}]","[{\"text\":\"because -TRUEFUL,\\n-PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle,\\nhowever, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the\\nsame way.\\n\\nSome of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"barely intelligible to\\nanyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example,\\nsuch a typical sentence from a 'Times' leading article as OLDTHINKERS\\nUNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one could make of this\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"in Oldspeak would be: 'Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution\\ncannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English\\nSocialism.'

But the\\nspecial function of certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINK was one,\\nwas not so much to express meanings \"}]","[{\"text\":\"as to destroy them. These words,\\nnecessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they\\ncontained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were\\nsufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak\\nDictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make\\nsure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words\\nthey cancelled by their existence.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"As we have already seen in the case of the word FREE, words which had\\nonce borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of\\nconvenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them.\\nCountless other words such as HONOUR, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"JUSTICE, MORALITY, INTERNATIONALISM,\\nDEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and RELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket\\nwords covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words\\ngrouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"instance, were contained in the single word CRIMETHINK, while all words\\ngrouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism\\nwere contained in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater precision would have\\nbeen dangerous. What was required in \"}]","[{\"text\":\"a Party member was an outlook similar\\nto that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that\\nall nations other than his own worshipped 'false gods'. He did not need to\\nknow that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"like: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy.\\nHe knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that\\nall gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhat\\nthe same way, the party member knew \"}]","[{\"text\":\"what constituted right conduct, and in\\nexceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from\\nit were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by\\nthe two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sexual immorality) and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"GOODSEX (chastity).\\nSEXCRIME covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication,\\nadultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal\\nintercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle,\\nall punishable by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific\\nand technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to\\ncertain sexual aberrations, but the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"ordinary citizen had no need of them.\\nHe knew what was meant by GOODSEX--that is to say, normal intercourse\\nbetween man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and\\nwithout physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was SEXCRIME.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further\\nthan the perception that it WAS heretical: beyond that point the necessary\\nwords were nonexistent.\\n\\nNo word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A \"}]","[{\"text\":\"great many were\\neuphemisms. Such words, for instance, as JOYCAMP (forced-labour camp) or\\nMINIPAX (Ministry of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exact\\nopposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand,\\ndisplayed a frank \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of\\nOceanic society. An example was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy\\nentertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses.\\nOther words, again, were ambivalent, having the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"connotation 'good' when\\napplied to the Party and 'bad' when applied to its enemies. But in\\naddition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared\\nto be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"from their meaning, but from their structure.\\n\\nSo far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have\\npolitical significance of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary. The\\nname of every organization, or body \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of people, or doctrine, or country, or\\ninstitution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar\\nshape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number\\nof syllables that would preserve the original \"}]","[{\"text\":\"derivation. In the Ministry\\nof Truth, for example, the Records Department, in which Winston Smith\\nworked, was called RECDEP, the Fiction Department was called FICDEP, the\\nTeleprogrammes Department was called TELEDEP, and so on. This was not\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"done solely with the object of saving time. Even in the early decades of\\nthe twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the\\ncharacteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed\\nthat the tendency to use \"}]","[{\"text\":\"abbreviations of this kind was most marked in\\ntotalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such\\nwords as NAZI, GESTAPO, COMINTERN, INPRECORR, AGITPROP. In the beginning\\nthe practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"but in Newspeak\\nit was used with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus\\nabbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by\\ncutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it.\\nThe words \"}]","[{\"text\":\"COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up a composite\\npicture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx,\\nand the Paris Commune. The word COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests\\nmerely a tightly-knit organization \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and a well-defined body of doctrine.\\nIt refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in\\npurpose, as a chair or a table. COMINTERN is a word that can be uttered\\nalmost without taking thought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phrase\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way,\\nthe associations called up by a word like MINITRUE are fewer and more\\ncontrollable than those called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted not\\nonly for the habit of abbreviating \"}]","[{\"text\":\"whenever possible, but also for the\\nalmost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily\\npronounceable.\\n\\nIn Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude\\nof meaning. Regularity of grammar was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"always sacrificed to it when it\\nseemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for\\npolitical purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which\\ncould be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"speaker's mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from\\nthe fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably\\nthese words--GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEXCRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC,\\nBELLYFEEL, THINKPOL, and countless \"}]","[{\"text\":\"others--were words of two or three\\nsyllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable\\nand the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at\\nonce staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not\\nideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness.\\nFor the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes\\nnecessary, to reflect before \"}]","[{\"text\":\"speaking, but a Party member called upon to\\nmake a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the\\ncorrect opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets.\\nHis training fitted him to do this, the language gave \"}]","[{\"text\":\"him an almost\\nfoolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound\\nand a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of\\nIngsoc, assisted the process still further.\\n\\nSo did the fact of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"having very few words to choose from. Relative to our\\nown, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were\\nconstantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other\\nlanguages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"larger every\\nyear. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice,\\nthe smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to\\nmake articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher\\nbrain centres at \"}]","[{\"text\":\"all. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word\\nDUCKSPEAK, meaning 'to quack like a duck'. Like various other words in\\nthe B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the\\nopinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it \"}]","[{\"text\":\"implied nothing but\\npraise, and when 'The Times' referred to one of the orators of the Party\\nas a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.\\n\\n\\nTHE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary \"}]","[{\"text\":\"was supplementary to the others and\\nconsisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the\\nscientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots,\\nbut the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"undesirable meanings. They followed the same grammatical rules as the\\nwords in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C words had any\\ncurrency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific\\nworker or technician could find all \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the words he needed in the list devoted\\nto his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the\\nwords occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common to\\nall lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"function of Science\\nas a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular\\nbranches. There was, indeed, no word for 'Science', any meaning that it\\ncould possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word INGSOC.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression\\nof unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible.\\nIt was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a\\nspecies of blasphemy. It would have \"}]","[{\"text\":\"been possible, for example, to say\\nBIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely\\nconveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by\\nreasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideas\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form,\\nand could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and\\ncondemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so.\\nOne could, in fact, only use Newspeak \"}]","[{\"text\":\"for unorthodox purposes by\\nillegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For\\nexample, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only\\nin the same sense in which ALL MEN ARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"sentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed\\na palpable untruth--i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or\\nstrength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this\\nsecondary meaning had accordingly \"}]","[{\"text\":\"been purged out of the word EQUAL.\\nIn 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication,\\nthe danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might\\nremember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK to avoid doing this, but within\\na couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have\\nvanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no\\nmore know that EQUAL had once had the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"secondary meaning of 'politically\\nequal', or that FREE had once meant 'intellectually free', than for\\ninstance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the\\nsecondary meanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would be many\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply\\nbecause they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be\\nforeseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics\\nof Newspeak would become more and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"more pronounced--its words growing\\nfewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of\\nputting them to improper uses always diminishing.\\n\\nWhen Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"the past would have been severed. History had already been rewritten,\\nbut fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there,\\nimperfectly censored, and so long as one retained one's knowledge of\\nOldspeak it was possible to read \"}]","[{\"text\":\"them. In the future such fragments, even\\nif they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable.\\nIt was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless\\nit either referred to some technical process or some \"}]","[{\"text\":\"very simple everyday\\naction, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would be the Newspeak\\nexpression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written before\\napproximately 1960 could be translated as a whole.

Before you head out, there are two other things you should know: how to avoid monsters and how to deal with hunger. Read on.\\n\\nAvoiding Monsters\\nThere's a key difference between the Minecraft world on the first and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"second days. In a word, mobs: hostile ones to be specific. Mobs only spawn in dark areas, and some only during the night, so if you are outside during your first day and stay in well-lit areas, you'll be reasonably safe. By the second day, however, mobs have had a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"chance to build their numbers and wander about. It's not that likely you'll encounter them on day 2, but it's best to be prepared. There are 14 types of hostile mobs in the Overworld. These are the ones you might meet on your second day outside:\\n> Zombies-Zombies \"}]","[{\"text\":\"burn up in sunlight but can still survive in shadows or rain, or when wearing a helmet, and, of course, in dark caves all hours of the day or night. They are relatively easy to defeat, and if any come after you, just head to a well-lit area and keep your distance \"}]","[{\"text\":\"while they burn up in the sun.\\n> Skeletons-Skeletons also burn up in sunlight unless they are wearing a helmet, and they can survive at any time in lower light conditions. They're quite deadly with a bow and arrow and best avoided until you have an iron \"}]","[{\"text\":\"sword and sufficient cover to avoid their line of fire.\\n> Spiders-Spiders come in two variants: large or blue. You'll probably only see the larger spiders at this stage. They are passive during the day but become hostile in shadow and can attack at any time if \"}]","[{\"text\":\"provoked. They'll climb, they'll jump, and they are pretty darn fast. Fortunately, they're also easy to kill with some swift sword attacks. The blue spiders are a smaller, poisonous variant called cave spiders. They live only in abandoned mine shafts underground, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"but in substantial numbers. If you suffer from arachnophobia, I don't have much good news for you, except that with a little time you'll get used to them and they won't seem quite so nasty.\\n> Creepers-Creepers have a well-earned reputation as the Minecraft bad \"}]","[{\"text\":\"guys. They are packed to their green gills with gunpowder, and they'll start their very short 1.5-second fuse as soon as they are within three blocks of you. Their explosion can cause a lot of real damage to you, nearby structures, and the environment in general. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"If you hear a creeper's fuse-a soft hissing noise-but can't see it, run like heck in the direction you're facing. Remember to sprint by double-tapping and holding your W key. With a little luck, you'll get three blocks away and the creeper's fuse will reset. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Creepers are usually best dealt with using a ranged attack from a bow and arrow, but if you sprint at them with an iron or diamond sword and take a swipe at just the right moment, you can send them flying back out of their suicidal detonation range, causing the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"fuse to reset. Most creepers despawn around noon, leaving the afternoon generally free of their particular brand of terror.\\n> Slimes-Slimes appear in the swamp biome and in some places underground. They initially spawn as quite large Jello-like green \"}]","[{\"text\":\"blocks and are more than capable of causing damage. Attacking eventually breaks them up into 2-4 new medium-sized slimes. These can still attack but are relatively easily killed, only to spawn a further 2-4 tiny slimes each! These last don't cause any attack \"}]","[{\"text\":\"damage, but may still push you into peril if you're unlucky.\\n\\nIf you come across a lone spider, a zombie, or even a slime, now is as good a time as any to get in some sword practice. Just point your crosshairs at thecreature and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"strike with the left mouse button. Keep clicking as fast as you can, and you've got a very good chance of killing the mob and picking up any items it drops before it lands too many blows. Try to avoid the other mobs for now.\\nSo how do you avoid mobs? Use these \"}]","[{\"text\":\"tips to survive:\\n> Stay in the open as much as you can, avoiding heavily wooded areas if possible.\\n> Most mobs have a 16-block detection radar. If they can also draw a line of sight to your position, they will enter pursuit mode. (Spiders can always \"}]","[{\"text\":\"detect you, even through other blocks.) At that point they'll relentlessly plot and follow a path to your position, tracking you through other blocks without requiring a line of sight. Pursuit mode stays engaged much farther than 16 blocks.\\n> Keep your sound \"}]","[{\"text\":\"turned up because you'll also hear mobs within 16 blocks, although creepers, befitting their name, are creepily quiet.\\n> Avoid skirting along the edges of hilly terrain. Creepers can drop on you from above with their fuse already ticking. Try to head \"}]","[{\"text\":\"directly up and down hills so you have a good view of the terrain ahead.\\n> Mobs are quite slow, so you can easily put some distance between them and yourself by keeping up a steady pace and circling around to get back to your shelter. Sprint mode will leave them \"}]","[{\"text\":\"far behind.\\n\\nHunger Management\\n\\nHunger plays a permanent role in Minecraft, much as in real life. While it's only possible to starve to death on Hard difficulty, hunger does affect your character in other ways, so it's \"}]","[{\"text\":\"always important to ensure you have the equivalent of a couple of sandwiches packed before heading deep into a mine or on a long trek. Hunger is a combination of two values: the one shown in the HUD's hunger bar, as well as a hidden value called saturation. The \"}]","[{\"text\":\"latter provides a buffer to the hunger bar, decreasing first. In fact, your hunger bar doesn't decrease at all until saturation reaches 0. At that point, you see the hunger bar start to jitter, and after a short while it takes its first hit. Saturation cannot \"}]","[{\"text\":\"exceed the value of the hunger bar, so with a full hunger bar of 20 points, it's possible to have up to 20 points of saturation. However, a hunger level of 6 points also only provides a maximum of 6 points of saturation, and that makes you vulnerable. You'll find \"}]","[{\"text\":\"some key information about the hunger system here:\\n> On Easy and Normal Survival modes, there is no need to worry too much about hunger because your character won't drop dead from it. If you're close to home and pottering around in your farm or constructing \"}]","[{\"text\":\"some building extensions, you're fairly safe, but your health starts to drop. Eat something as soon as you can to fill your hunger bar, and rebuild your health.\\n> Sprinting isn't possible when the hunger bar drops below 6 hunger points, or 3 shanks, as \"}]","[{\"text\":\"shown in the HUD.\\n> Keeping a relatively full stomach at 18 hunger points (9 shanks in the HUD) allows health to regenerate at 1 point (half a heart) every 4 seconds.\\n> Health depletes if the hunger bar drops to 0, increasing the risk of dying from one of the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"many imaginative ways Minecraft has on offer (see Figure 3.5).\\n> There are some limits to the amount health can drop according to the difficulty level. On Easy, health cannot deplete from hunger further than 10 points, or half the full quotient. On \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Normal, it drops to 1 point, which is an extreme level of vulnerability. On Hard difficulty, there are no limits; don't ignore the hunger bar, or death from starvation could be just moments away. See \\\"Food on the Run\\\" later in this chapter to help avoid this.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"Your Mission: Food, Resources, and Reconnaissance\\n\\nYour second day is the perfect opportunity to gather food and other resources and to take a quick survey of the landscape surrounding your first shelter, in particular to find somewhere \"}]","[{\"text\":\"suitable for your first outdoor abode. Keep an eye out for any of the following:\\n> Passive mobs-Chickens, pigs, and cows all provide a ready source of food, or at least raw protein that can be cooked on the furnace and made more nutritious. Cows also \"}]","[{\"text\":\"drop leather that you can use for your first armor, and when you have an iron bucket, cows can be milked, giving you an instant cure for food poisoning. Chickens also lay eggs, so gather any that you find.\\n> Natural harvest-The harvest includes cocoa pods, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"apples, cactus, sugar cane, carrots and potatoes (found in villages), and seeds. Knock down tall grass to find seeds. When you plant the seeds, they mature into wheat within 5-8 day/night cycles. From wheat, it's easy to bake bread, one of the simplest but most \"}]","[{\"text\":\"effective sources of food, especially if there are no passive mobs nearby. See Chapter 6, \\\"Crop Farming,\\\" for more on agricultural techniques.\\n> Construction resources-You can mine plenty of cobblestone quite safely by expanding your original shelter, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"digging into the terrain. But some other resources will definitely come in handy. Wood is always useful. If you see any sand, mine it so you can smelt it into glass blocks to let light into your shelter, and provide a view. (There's no point moving from your first \"}]","[{\"text\":\"cave into the outdoor equivalent of another!) Also keep an eye out for coal. You can often see it in veins on the surface of the walls of small caves or on the sides of cliffs. If you can safely get to it, make like a miner and dig it out. Use the coal to make \"}]","[{\"text\":\"torches and to smelt other ores.\\n\\nStart early, heading out with a stone sword at the ready, just in case. If you are low on wood, swing an axe at a few nearby trees. Move carefully so you don't lose your bearings. The sun rises in the east \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and sets in the west, and the clouds always travel from east to west, so you can always at least get your bearings. Following a compass cardinal point (north, south, east, or west) using the sun and clouds as a reference can lead you away and reasonably accurately \"}]","[{\"text\":\"back home again.\\n\\nFood on the Run\\n\\nIf you are getting dangerously hungry, head to the nearest equivalent of a fast food outlet- a passive mob-sword at the ready. Your best bet is to look for cows and pigs because they each \"}]","[{\"text\":\"can drop up to three pieces of raw meat, with each piece restoring 3 hunger units and 1.8 in saturation. They're an excellent target of opportunity. You can also eat raw chicken, although with a 30% chance of developing food poisoning, or you can try rotten meat \"}]","[{\"text\":\"harvested from zombies, which is guaranteed to give you a taste of the stomach aches. But you can also cure any type of food poisoning by drinking milk obtained with a bucket clicked on a cow, and you can eat any amount of poisoned meat, gaining the restorative \"}]","[{\"text\":\"benefits, and curing the whole lot with one serving of milk. So keep that rotten flesh the zombies drop around! And the bucket o' milk. That said, unless you are desperate, it is actually much better to take the time to cook all your meat first. In fact, the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"secondary processing of foods makes them all healthier, restoring more hunger and saturation points. It's therefore quite handy to always carry a furnace in your inventory, along with fuel. When you've finished cooking, break the furnace down with a pickaxe, and it \"}]","[{\"text\":\"floats back into your inventory. If you don't mind seeming like a crazed pyromaniac, you can also both kill and cook pigs, chickens, and cows in one blazing swoop by setting the ground beneath them on fire with a flint and steel (right-click on the ground, not the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"animal), or a little more chaotically by pouring lava from a bucket. Just take caution that you don't do this anywhere it could pose a risk, such as near that fantastic wood cabin you just spent the last three weeks building; there's no Undo key in Minecraft. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Finally, if you simply cannot find mobs, your hunger bar has dropped to 0, and your health has plummeted to half a point, consider at least planting a wheat field and waiting it out in your shelter for three blocks of wheat to grow so you can harvest them and bake \"}]","[{\"text\":\"bread. There's one final alternative, and this is a pretty neat trick. Assuming you have reset your spawn point to a bed or are still near origin, head to your shelter, place everything you carry in a chest, and then head outside and either jump off a cliff, drown \"}]","[{\"text\":\"in a lake, or wait for a mob to kill you. You respawn back in your shelter with full health, a full hunger bar, and all your possessions waiting for you. Get dressed, fully equipped, and head out there to try again.\\n\\nFinding a Building \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Site\\n\\nAs you scout around, keep in mind that you are also looking for a new building site. This doesn't have to be fancy or even particularly large. A 6x5 space manages just fine, and even 6x4 can squeeze in the basics. You can also \"}]","[{\"text\":\"level ground and break down a few trees to clear space. I did this in Figure 3.7. The site is located just up the hill from the first dugout, overlooking the same lake and river system. I usually prefer space that's a little elevated because it provides a better \"}]","[{\"text\":\"view of the surroundings, but it's perfectly possible to create a protected space just about anywhere. You may even decide to go a little hybrid, building a house that's both tunneled into a hill and extending outside. So what can we build on this site?

Some of them are a natural early focus as you improve your position from those gathered for first-night survival; others become more important as you get further \"}]","[{\"text\":\"through the game, gear up for your exploration of The Nether and The End regions, and become more creative with all that Minecraft has to offer. Here's a quick summary of the different categories. You can view all possible tools and resources by opening your \"}]","[{\"text\":\"inventory in Creative mode, as shown in Figure 3.10. The categories that follow correspond to the tabs running across the upper and lower sections of the Creative mode inventory.\\n> Building Blocks-Building blocks are used, as you might expect, for \"}]","[{\"text\":\"construction, including housing and almost anything else. Build a bridge for your redstone rail. Construct a dam. Elevate a farm above a level that won't get trampled by mobs, or put up a fence. Build a skyscraper or reconstruct a monument.

You can store many items more \"}]","[{\"text\":\"efficiently (for example, by converting nine gold ingots into a single gold block), and climb more efficiently by crafting stairs instead of jumping up and down blocks on well-travelled routes. Building blocks are, without being too punny, the building blocks of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"creativity.\\n> Decoration Blocks-Decoration blocks are something of a catchall category. Generally, they are things you can use to make your constructions more interesting. Some of those are just visual, such as carpet, whereas others such as crafting tables, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"chests, and the bed that keeps you safe at night provide vital functions.\\n> Redstone-Redstone is an almost magical resource. You can use it to build powered circuits, quite complex ones, and then activate pistons to automatically harvest a farm plot, set up \"}]","[{\"text\":\"traps, open and close doors, and a huge amount more. The limits are set only by your imagination. Redstone is also used to craft powered rail tracks and a range of other useful items such as a compass and clock. See Chapter 9, \\\"Redstone, Rails, and More,\\\" for more \"}]","[{\"text\":\"information.\\n> Transportation-Transportation is a small category, but one that's a lot of fun and very useful. It includes powered and unpowered rails, minecarts, a saddle, a boat, and anything else related to moving yourself and other items around. There are \"}]","[{\"text\":\"enough options there to enable you to build everything from massive transportation systems to incredible roller coasters.\\n> Miscellaneous-Miscellaneous contains a range of useful and obscure items. You'll find the buckets quite handy for setting up new \"}]","[{\"text\":\"water and lava sources, and you can use the eggs to spawn most of the mobs, populating a farm and more.\\n> Foodstuffs-Foodstuffs contains the full range of edibles, including the enchanted form of the golden apple, the rarest edible in the game. Take a few \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of these with you the next  time you think you'll be in a tight spot, and you may just be able to make it through that moaning zombie horde.\\n> Tools-Tools can be wielded as weapons, but not very effectively. They are, however, great at digging, chopping, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"hoeing, and setting Nether Portals on fire with the flint and steel. You'll also find shears for stripping the wool from sheep, a fishing rod, and a few enchanted books that can add special powers to your tools.\\n> Combat-Combat provides your weapons \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and armor, as well as the remaining enchanted books that relate to combat items.\\n> Brewing-The Brewing tab contains all possible potions and a number of the rarer ingredients required that don't fit into other categories. Potions are incredibly handy. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Caught outside at night? The Potion of Night Vision triples the brightness to almost daylight conditions. You can learn more about brewing in Chapter 10.\\n> Materials-Materials is the final catchall category, along with the miscellaneous and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"decoration blocks.
