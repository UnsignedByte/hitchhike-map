There were no windows\"}]","[{\"text\":\"Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor\"},{\"text\":\"within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except\"},{\"text\":\"on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of\"}]","[{\"text\":\"machine-gun nests. Even\"},{\"text\":\"the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced\"},{\"text\":\"guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.\"},{\"text\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the\"}]","[{\"text\":\"expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing\"},{\"text\":\"the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen.

With the next he was more successful.\"},{\"text\":\"He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood\"}]","[{\"text\":\"telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a\"},{\"text\":\"penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a\"},{\"text\":\"red back and a marbled cover.\"},{\"text\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual\"}]","[{\"text\":\"position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where\"},{\"text\":\"it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the\"},{\"text\":\"window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston\"}]","[{\"text\":\"flats were built, had probably been\"},{\"text\":\"intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well\"},{\"text\":\"back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so\"},{\"text\":\"far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed\"}]","[{\"text\":\"in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual\"},{\"text\":\"geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now\"},{\"text\":\"about to do.\"},{\"text\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of\"}]","[{\"text\":\"the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper,\"},{\"text\":\"a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for\"},{\"text\":\"at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much\"}]","[{\"text\":\"in the window of a frowsy little\"},{\"text\":\"junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not\"},{\"text\":\"now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire\"},{\"text\":\"to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops\"}]","[{\"text\":\"('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was not\"},{\"text\":\"strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and\"},{\"text\":\"razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He\"}]","[{\"text\":\"the street and then had slipped inside\"},{\"text\":\"and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious\"},{\"text\":\"of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home\"}]","[{\"text\":\"was a compromising\"},{\"text\":\"possession.\"},{\"text\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal\"},{\"text\":\"(nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected\"}]","[{\"text\":\"death, or at least\"},{\"text\":\"by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into\"},{\"text\":\"the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off.

Actually he was not used to writing\"}]","[{\"text\":\"dictate everything\"},{\"text\":\"into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present\"},{\"text\":\"purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a\"},{\"text\":\"second. A tremor had gone through his bowels.

A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To\"}]","[{\"text\":\"begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It\"},{\"text\":\"must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was\"},{\"text\":\"thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but\"}]","[{\"text\":\"down any date within a year or two.\"},{\"text\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?\"},{\"text\":\"For the future, for the unborn.

Either the future would resemble the present,\"}]","[{\"text\":\"would not listen to him: or it would be different from it,\"},{\"text\":\"and his predicament would be meaningless.\"},{\"text\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had\"}]","[{\"text\":\"music. It was curious that he seemed\"},{\"text\":\"not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have\"},{\"text\":\"forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks\"},{\"text\":\"past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed\"}]","[{\"text\":\"his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing\"},{\"text\":\"would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable\"},{\"text\":\"restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for\"}]","[{\"text\":\"the monologue had dried up. Moreover\"},{\"text\":\"his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it,\"},{\"text\":\"because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking\"},{\"text\":\"by.

Winston was just taking his place in one of the\"},{\"text\":\"middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken\"}]","[{\"text\":\"girl whom he often\"},{\"text\":\"passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she\"},{\"text\":\"worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably--since he had sometimes seen\"},{\"text\":\"her with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical job\"}]","[{\"text\":\"novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of\"},{\"text\":\"about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic\"},{\"text\":\"movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was\"}]","[{\"text\":\"just tightly enough to\"},{\"text\":\"bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the\"},{\"text\":\"very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the\"},{\"text\":\"atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general\"}]","[{\"text\":\"clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked\"},{\"text\":\"nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always\"},{\"text\":\"the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted\"}]","[{\"text\":\"swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and\"},{\"text\":\"nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression\"},{\"text\":\"of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor\"}]","[{\"text\":\"pierce right into\"},{\"text\":\"him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even\"},{\"text\":\"crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That,\"},{\"text\":\"it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar\"}]","[{\"text\":\"had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever\"},{\"text\":\"she was anywhere near him.\"},{\"text\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and\"},{\"text\":\"holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim\"}]","[{\"text\":\"idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people\"},{\"text\":\"round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member\"},{\"text\":\"approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse,\"}]","[{\"text\":\"his formidable appearance he had a\"},{\"text\":\"certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on\"},{\"text\":\"his nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiously\"},{\"text\":\"civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such\"}]","[{\"text\":\"terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his\"},{\"text\":\"snuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many\"},{\"text\":\"years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued\"}]","[{\"text\":\"urbane manner and his prize-fighter's\"},{\"text\":\"physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps\"},{\"text\":\"not even a belief, merely a hope--that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was\"},{\"text\":\"not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again,\"}]","[{\"text\":\"perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but\"},{\"text\":\"simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a\"},{\"text\":\"person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and\"}]","[{\"text\":\"the smallest effort to verify this\"},{\"text\":\"guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced\"},{\"text\":\"at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently\"},{\"text\":\"decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was\"}]","[{\"text\":\"over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.\"},{\"text\":\"A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was\"},{\"text\":\"between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.\"},{\"text\":\"\"}]","[{\"text\":\"hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine\"},{\"text\":\"running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.\"},{\"text\":\"It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the\"},{\"text\":\"back of one's neck. The Hate had started.\"}]","[{\"text\":\"As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had\"},{\"text\":\"flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the\"},{\"text\":\"audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and backslider who once, long ago\"},{\"text\":\"(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading\"},{\"text\":\"figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and\"},{\"text\":\"then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned\"}]","[{\"text\":\"to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes\"},{\"text\":\"of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in\"},{\"text\":\"which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor,\"}]","[{\"text\":\"purity. All subsequent crimes against\"},{\"text\":\"the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations,\"},{\"text\":\"sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still\"},{\"text\":\"alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea,\"}]","[{\"text\":\"under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it was\"},{\"text\":\"occasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.\"},{\"text\":\"\"},{\"text\":\"Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of\"}]","[{\"text\":\"a painful mixture of emotions.

It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a\"},{\"text\":\"sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack\"},{\"text\":\"upon the doctrines of the Party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse that\"}]","[{\"text\":\"a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible\"},{\"text\":\"enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less\"},{\"text\":\"level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it.

He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia\"},{\"text\":\"or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was\"}]","[{\"text\":\"generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although\"},{\"text\":\"Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a\"},{\"text\":\"thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers,\"}]","[{\"text\":\"smashed, ridiculed, held up to the\"},{\"text\":\"general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this,\"},{\"text\":\"his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes\"},{\"text\":\"waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs\"}]","[{\"text\":\"acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.\"},{\"text\":\"He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of\"},{\"text\":\"conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its\"}]","[{\"text\":\"also whispered stories of a terrible\"},{\"text\":\"book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author\"},{\"text\":\"and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a\"},{\"text\":\"title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew\"}]","[{\"text\":\"of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor\"},{\"text\":\"THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if\"},{\"text\":\"there was a way of avoiding it.\"},{\"text\":\"\"}]","[{\"text\":\"were leaping up and\"},{\"text\":\"down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort\"},{\"text\":\"to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen.

Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed.\"},{\"text\":\"He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and\"},{\"text\":\"quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave.

It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued\"}]","[{\"text\":\"shouting with the\"},{\"text\":\"others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The\"},{\"text\":\"horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to\"},{\"text\":\"act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining\"}]","[{\"text\":\"seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous\"},{\"text\":\"ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash\"},{\"text\":\"faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of\"}]","[{\"text\":\"against one's will into\"},{\"text\":\"a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an\"},{\"text\":\"abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to\"},{\"text\":\"another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred\"}]","[{\"text\":\"was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against\"},{\"text\":\"Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his\"},{\"text\":\"heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian\"}]","[{\"text\":\"lies.

Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one\"}]","[{\"text\":\"head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded\"},{\"text\":\"in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired\"},{\"text\":\"girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.\"}]","[{\"text\":\"rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked\"},{\"text\":\"to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian.
