But, as thoughts are frozen and utterance\\nbenumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his\\naudience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and\\napprehensive, though not the closest \"}]","[{\"text\":\"friend, is listening to our talk;\\nand then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness,\\nwe may prate of the circumstances that lie around us, and even of\\nourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil. To this extent,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and within these limits, an author, methinks, may be autobiographical,\\nwithout violating either the reader’s rights or his own.\\n\\nIt will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch has a certain\\npropriety, of a kind always \"}]","[{\"text\":\"recognized in literature, as explaining\\nhow a large portion of the following pages came into my possession,\\nand as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein\\ncontained. This, in fact,—a desire to put myself in my \"}]","[{\"text\":\"true position\\nas editor, or very little more, of the most prolix among the tales\\nthat make up my volume,—this, and no other, is my true reason for\\nassuming a personal relation with the public. In accomplishing the\\nmain purpose, it \"}]","[{\"text\":\"has appeared allowable, by a few extra touches, to\\ngive a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore\\ndescribed, together with some of the characters that move in it, among\\nwhom the author happened to make one.\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"*       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIn my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago,\\nin the days of old King Derby, was a bustling wharf,—but which is now\\nburdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits \"}]","[{\"text\":\"few or no\\nsymptoms of commercial life; except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way\\ndown its melancholy length, discharging hides; or, nearer at hand, a\\nNova Scotia schooner, pitching out her cargo of firewood,—at the\\nhead, I say, of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"this dilapidated wharf, which the tide often\\noverflows, and along which, at the base and in the rear of the row of\\nbuildings, the track of many languid years is seen in a border of\\nunthrifty grass,—here, with a view from its front \"}]","[{\"text\":\"windows adown this\\nnot very enlivening prospect, and thence across the harbor, stands a\\nspacious edifice of brick. From the loftiest point of its roof, during\\nprecisely three and a half hours of each forenoon, floats or droops,\\nin breeze or calm, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the banner of the republic; but with the thirteen\\nstripes turned vertically, instead of horizontally, and thus\\nindicating that a civil, and not a military post of Uncle Sam’s\\ngovernment is here established. Its front is ornamented \"}]","[{\"text\":\"with a portico\\nof half a dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony, beneath which a\\nflight of wide granite steps descends towards the street. Over the\\nentrance hovers an enormous specimen of the American eagle, with\\noutspread wings, a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"shield before her breast, and, if I recollect\\naright, a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each\\nclaw. With the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this\\nunhappy fowl, she appears, by the fierceness of her beak \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and eye, and\\nthe general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to the\\ninoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens, careful of\\ntheir safety, against intruding on the premises which she overshadows\\nwith her wings. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are\\nseeking, at this very moment, to shelter themselves under the wing of\\nthe federal eagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the\\nsoftness and snugness of an eider-down pillow. But she \"}]","[{\"text\":\"has no great\\ntenderness, even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later,—oftener\\nsoon than late,—is apt to fling off her nestlings, with a scratch of\\nher claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbed\\narrows.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"The pavement round about the above-described edifice—which we may as\\nwell name at once as the Custom-House of the port—has grass enough\\ngrowing in its chinks to show that it has not, of late days, been worn\\nby any multitudinous resort of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"business. In some months of the year,\\nhowever, there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with\\na livelier tread.

On \"}]","[{\"text\":\"some such morning, when three or\\nfour vessels happen to have arrived at once,—usually from Africa or\\nSouth America,—or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward,\\nthere is a sound of frequent feet, passing briskly up and down the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"granite steps. Here, before his own wife has greeted him, you may\\ngreet the sea-flushed shipmaster, just in port, with his vessel’s\\npapers under his arm, in a tarnished tin box.

Another figure in the scene is the outward-bound sailor\\nin quest of a protection; or the recently arrived one, pale and\\nfeeble, seeking a passport to the hospital. Nor must we forget the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"captains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the\\nBritish provinces; a rough-looking set of tarpaulins, without the\\nalertness of the Yankee aspect, but contributing an item of no slight\\nimportance to our decaying trade.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"Cluster all these individuals together, as they sometimes were, with\\nother miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, for the time\\nbeing, it made the Custom-House a stirring scene. More frequently,\\nhowever, on ascending the steps, you \"}]","[{\"text\":\"would discern—in the entry, if\\nit were summer time, or in their appropriate rooms, if wintry or\\ninclement weather—a row of venerable figures, sitting in\\nold-fashioned chairs, which were tipped on their hind legs back\\nagainst the wall. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Oftentimes they were asleep, but occasionally might\\nbe heard talking together, in voices between speech and a snore, and\\nwith that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of\\nalmshouses, and all other human beings who depend for \"}]","[{\"text\":\"subsistence on\\ncharity, on monopolized labor, or anything else, but their own\\nindependent exertions. These old gentlemen—seated, like Matthew, at\\nthe receipt of customs, but not very liable to be summoned thence,\\nlike him, for \"}]","[{\"text\":\"apostolic errands—were Custom-House officers.\\n\\nFurthermore, on the left hand as you enter the front door, is a\\ncertain room or office, about fifteen feet square, and of a lofty\\nheight; with two of its arched \"}]","[{\"text\":\"windows commanding a view of the\\naforesaid dilapidated wharf, and the third looking across a narrow\\nlane, and along a portion of Derby Street. All three give glimpses of\\nthe shops of grocers, block-makers, slop-sellers, and ship-chandlers;\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"around the doors of which are generally to be seen, laughing and\\ngossiping, clusters of old salts, and such other wharf-rats as haunt\\nthe Wapping of a seaport.

In the way of furniture, there is a stove with a\\nvoluminous funnel; an old pine desk, with a three-legged stool beside\\nit; two or three wooden-bottom chairs, exceedingly decrepit and\\ninfirm; and—not to forget the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"library—on some shelves, a score or\\ntwo of volumes of the Acts of Congress, and a bulky Digest of the\\nRevenue Laws. A tin pipe ascends through the ceiling, and forms a\\nmedium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice. And\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"here, some six months ago,—pacing from corner to corner, or lounging\\non the long-legged stool, with his elbow on the desk, and his eyes\\nwandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaper,—you might\\nhave recognized, honored reader, the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"same individual who welcomed you\\ninto his cheery little study, where the sunshine glimmered so\\npleasantly through the willow branches, on the western side of the Old\\nManse.

Indeed, so far as its\\nphysical aspect is concerned, with \"}]","[{\"text\":\"its flat, unvaried surface, covered\\nchiefly with wooden houses, few or none of which pretend to\\narchitectural beauty,—its irregularity, which is neither picturesque\\nnor quaint, but only tame,—its long and lazy street, lounging\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula, with Gallows\\nHill and New Guinea at one end, and a view of the almshouse at the\\nother,—such being the features of my native town, it would be quite\\nas reasonable to form a sentimental \"}]","[{\"text\":\"attachment to a disarranged\\nchecker-board. And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere, there is\\nwithin me a feeling for old Salem, which, in lack of a better phrase,\\nI must be content to call affection. The sentiment is probably\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has struck into\\nthe soil. It is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the\\noriginal Briton, the earliest emigrant of my name, made his appearance\\nin the wild and forest-bordered \"}]","[{\"text\":\"settlement, which has since become a\\ncity.

Few\\nof my countrymen can know what it is; nor, as frequent transplantation\\nis perhaps better for the stock, need \"}]","[{\"text\":\"they consider it desirable to\\nknow.\\n\\nBut the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that\\nfirst ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky\\ngrandeur, was present to my boyish \"}]","[{\"text\":\"imagination, as far back as I can\\nremember.

So deep a stain, indeed, that his old dry\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"bones, in the Charter Street burial-ground, must still retain it, if\\nthey have not crumbled utterly to dust! I know not whether these\\nancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of\\nHeaven for their cruelties; or \"}]","[{\"text\":\"whether they are now groaning under the\\nheavy consequences of them, in another state of being.

The boy, also, in due time, passed from the forecastle to\\nthe cabin, spent a tempestuous manhood, and returned from his\\nworld-wanderings, to grow old, and die, and mingle his dust with the\\nnatal earth. This \"}]","[{\"text\":\"long connection of a family with one spot, as its\\nplace of birth and burial, creates a kindred between the human being\\nand the locality, quite independent of any charm in the scenery or\\nmoral circumstances that surround him.

Nevertheless, this very sentiment is an evidence that the\\nconnection, which \"}]","[{\"text\":\"has become an unhealthy one, should at last be\\nsevered. Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it\\nbe planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the\\nsame worn-out soil.

My doom was on me. It was not the first\\ntime, nor the second, that I had gone away,—as it seemed,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"permanently,—but yet returned, like the bad half-penny; or as if\\nSalem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe. So, one fine\\nmorning, I ascended the flight of granite steps, with the President’s\\ncommission in my pocket, and was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"introduced to the corps of gentlemen\\nwho were to aid me in my weighty responsibility, as chief executive\\nofficer of the Custom-House.\\n\\nI doubt greatly—or, rather, I do not doubt at all—whether any public\\nfunctionary of the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"United States, either in the civil or military\\nline, has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his\\norders as myself. The whereabouts of the Oldest Inhabitant was at once\\nsettled, when I looked at them. For upwards of twenty \"}]","[{\"text\":\"years before\\nthis epoch, the independent position of the Collector had kept the\\nSalem Custom-House out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude,\\nwhich makes the tenure of office generally so fragile. A soldier,—New\\nEngland’s most \"}]","[{\"text\":\"distinguished soldier,—he stood firmly on the pedestal\\nof his gallant services; and, himself secure in the wise liberality of\\nthe successive administrations through which he had held office, he\\nhad been the safety of his subordinates in many an hour \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of danger and\\nheart-quake. General Miller was radically conservative; a man over\\nwhose kindly nature habit had no slight influence; attaching himself\\nstrongly to familiar faces, and with difficulty moved to change, even\\nwhen change might \"}]","[{\"text\":\"have brought unquestionable improvement. Thus, on\\ntaking charge of my department, I found few but aged men. They were\\nancient sea-captains, for the most part, who, after being tost on\\nevery sea, and standing up sturdily against life’s \"}]","[{\"text\":\"tempestuous blasts,\\nhad finally drifted into this quiet nook; where, with little to\\ndisturb them, except the periodical terrors of a Presidential\\nelection, they one and all acquired a new lease of existence. Though\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"by no means less liable than their fellow-men to age and infirmity,\\nthey had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay. Two\\nor three of their number, as I was assured, being gouty and rheumatic,\\nor perhaps bedridden, never dreamed \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of making their appearance at the\\nCustom-House, during a large part of the year; but, after a torpid\\nwinter, would creep out into the warm sunshine of May or June, go\\nlazily about what they termed duty, and, at their own leisure and\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"convenience, betake themselves to bed again. I must plead guilty to\\nthe charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of\\nthese venerable servants of the republic. They were allowed, on my\\nrepresentation, to rest from their \"}]","[{\"text\":\"arduous labors, and soon\\nafterwards—as if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their\\ncountry’s service, as I verily believe it was—withdrew to a better\\nworld. It is a pious consolation to me, that, through my interference,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and\\ncorrupt practices into which, as a matter of course, every\\nCustom-House officer must be supposed to fall.

It was well for their\\nvenerable brotherhood that the new Surveyor was not a politician, and\\nthough a faithful Democrat in principle, neither \"}]","[{\"text\":\"received nor held his\\noffice with any reference to political services. Had it been\\notherwise,—had an active politician been put into this influential\\npost, to assume the easy task of making head against a Whig Collector,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"whose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his\\noffice,—hardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of\\nofficial life, within a month after the exterminating angel had come\\nup the Custom-House steps. According \"}]","[{\"text\":\"to the received code in such\\nmatters, it would have been nothing short of duty, in a politician, to\\nbring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine.\\nIt was plain enough to discern, that the old fellows dreaded some such\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"discourtesy at my hands. It pained, and at the same time amused me, to\\nbehold the terrors that attended my advent; to see a furrowed cheek,\\nweather-beaten by half a century of storm, turn ashy pale at the\\nglance of so harmless an individual \"}]","[{\"text\":\"as myself; to detect, as one or\\nanother addressed me, the tremor of a voice, which, in long-past days,\\nhad been wont to bellow through a speaking-trumpet, hoarsely enough to\\nfrighten Boreas himself to silence.

The careless\\nsecurity of his life in the Custom-House, on a regular income, and\\nwith but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal, had no doubt\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"contributed to make time pass lightly over him. The original and more\\npotent causes, however, lay in the rare perfection of his animal\\nnature, the moderate proportion of intellect, and the very trifling\\nadmixture of moral and spiritual \"}]","[{\"text\":\"ingredients; these latter qualities,\\nindeed, being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from\\nwalking on all-fours. He possessed no power of thought, no depth of\\nfeeling, no troublesome sensibilities; nothing, in short, but a few\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"commonplace instincts, which, aided by the cheerful temper that grew\\ninevitably out of his physical well-being, did duty very respectably,\\nand to general acceptance, in lieu of a heart.

Here, one would suppose, might have been sorrow\\nenough to imbue the sunniest disposition, through and through, with a\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"sable tinge. Not so with our old Inspector! One brief sigh sufficed to\\ncarry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences.

It might be difficult—and it was so—to conceive how he\\nshould exist hereafter, so earthly and sensuous did he seem; but\\nsurely his existence here, admitting that it was to terminate with his\\nlast breath, had been not unkindly \"}]","[{\"text\":\"given; with no higher moral\\nresponsibilities than the beasts of the field, but with a larger scope\\nof enjoyment than theirs, and with all their blessed immunity from the\\ndreariness and duskiness of age.\\n\\nOne point, in \"}]","[{\"text\":\"which he had vastly the advantage over his four-footed\\nbrethren, was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had\\nmade no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat.

As he\\npossessed no higher attribute, and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any\\nspiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to\\nsubserve the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"delight and profit of his maw, it always pleased and\\nsatisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher’s\\nmeat, and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table.\\nHis reminiscences of good cheer, however ancient the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"date of the\\nactual banquet, seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under one’s\\nvery nostrils. There were flavors on his palate that had lingered\\nthere not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still apparently\\nas fresh as that \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of the mutton-chop which he had just devoured for his\\nbreakfast. I have heard him smack his lips over dinners, every guest\\nat which, except himself, had long been food for worms.

A tender-loin of\\nbeef, a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"hind-quarter of veal, a spare-rib of pork, a particular\\nchicken, or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey, which had perhaps\\nadorned his board in the days of the elder Adams, would be remembered;\\nwhile all the subsequent experience of our race, and all \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the events\\nthat brightened or darkened his individual career, had gone over him\\nwith as little permanent effect as the passing breeze. The chief\\ntragic event of the old man’s life, so far as I could judge, was his\\nmishap with a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty\\nyears ago; a goose of most promising figure, but which, at table,\\nproved so inveterately tough that the carving-knife would make no\\nimpression on its carcass, and it could only be divided \"}]","[{\"text\":\"with an axe\\nand handsaw.\\n\\nBut it is time to quit this sketch; on which, however, I should be\\nglad to dwell at considerably more length because, of all men whom I\\nhave ever known, this individual was fittest to be a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Custom-House\\nofficer.

The\\nstep was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge. It was only\\nwith the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"assistance of a servant, and by leaning his hand heavily on\\nthe iron balustrade, that he could slowly and painfully ascend the\\nCustom-House steps, and, with a toilsome progress across the floor,\\nattain his customary chair beside the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"fireplace. There he used to sit,\\ngazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came\\nand went; amid the rustle of papers, the administering of oaths, the\\ndiscussion of business, and the casual talk of the office; all which\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his\\nsenses, and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of\\ncontemplation. His countenance, in this repose, was mild and kindly.\\nIf his notice was sought, an \"}]","[{\"text\":\"expression of courtesy and interest\\ngleamed out upon his features; proving that there was light within\\nhim, and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp\\nthat obstructed the rays in their passage. The closer you penetrated\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"to the substance of his mind, the sounder it appeared. When no longer\\ncalled upon to speak, or listen, either of which operations cost him\\nan evident effort, his face would briefly subside into its former not\\nuncheerful quietude. It was not \"}]","[{\"text\":\"painful to behold this look; for,\\nthough dim, it had not the imbecility of decaying age. The framework\\nof his nature, originally strong and massive, was not yet crumbled\\ninto ruin.\\n\\nTo observe and define his character, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"however, under such\\ndisadvantages, was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up\\nanew, in imagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, from a view\\nof its gray and broken ruins. Here and there, perchance, the walls may\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"remain almost complete, but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound,\\ncumbrous with its very strength, and overgrown, through long years of\\npeace and neglect, with grass and alien weeds.\\n\\nNevertheless, looking at the old \"}]","[{\"text\":\"warrior with affection,—for, slight\\nas was the communication between us, my feeling towards him, like that\\nof all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him, might not improperly be\\ntermed so,—I could discern the main points of his portrait. It was\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not\\nby a mere accident, but of good right, that he had won a distinguished\\nname. His spirit could never, I conceive, have been characterized by\\nan uneasy activity; it must, at any \"}]","[{\"text\":\"period of his life, have required\\nan impulse to set him in motion; but, once stirred up, with obstacles\\nto overcome, and an adequate object to be attained, it was not in the\\nman to give out or fail. The heat that had formerly pervaded his\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"nature, and which was not yet extinct, was never of the kind that\\nflashes and flickers in a blaze; but, rather, a deep, red glow, as of\\niron in a furnace.

But I could imagine, even then, that, under\\nsome excitement which should go deeply into his consciousness,—roused\\nby a trumpet-peal, loud enough to awaken all his energies that were\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"not dead, but only slumbering,—he was yet capable of flinging off his\\ninfirmities like a sick man’s gown, dropping the staff of age to seize\\na battle-sword, and starting up once more a warrior. And, in so\\nintense a moment, his demeanor would \"}]","[{\"text\":\"have still been calm. Such an\\nexhibition, however, was but to be pictured in fancy; not to be\\nanticipated, nor desired. What I saw in him—as evidently as the\\nindestructible ramparts of Old Ticonderoga already cited as the most\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"appropriate simile—were the features of stubborn and ponderous\\nendurance, which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier\\ndays; of integrity, that, like most of his other endowments, lay in a\\nsomewhat heavy mass, and was just as \"}]","[{\"text\":\"unmalleable and unmanageable as a\\nton of iron ore; and of benevolence, which, fiercely as he led the\\nbayonets on at Chippewa or Fort Erie, I take to be of quite as genuine\\na stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"the age. He had slain men with his own hand, for aught I\\nknow,—certainly, they had fallen, like blades of grass at the sweep\\nof the scythe, before the charge to which his spirit imparted its\\ntriumphant energy;—but, be that as it might, there was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"never in his\\nheart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterfly’s\\nwing. I have not known the man to whose innate kindliness I would more\\nconfidently make an appeal.\\n\\nMany characteristics—and those, too, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"which contribute not the least\\nforcibly to impart resemblance in a sketch—must have vanished, or\\nbeen obscured, before I met the General.

Still, even in\\nrespect of grace and beauty, there \"}]","[{\"text\":\"were points well worth noting. A\\nray of humor, now and then, would make its way through the veil of dim\\nobstruction, and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces. A trait of native\\nelegance, seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"early youth, was shown in the General’s fondness for the sight and\\nfragrance of flowers. An old soldier might be supposed to prize only\\nthe bloody laurel on his brow; but here was one who seemed to have a\\nyoung girl’s appreciation of the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"floral tribe.\\n\\nThere, beside the fireplace, the brave old General used to sit; while\\nthe Surveyor—though seldom, when it could be avoided, taking upon\\nhimself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation—was fond\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"of standing at a distance, and watching his quiet and almost\\nslumberous countenance. He seemed away from us, although we saw him\\nbut a few yards off; remote, though we passed close beside his chair;\\nunattainable, though we might have \"}]","[{\"text\":\"stretched forth our hands and\\ntouched his own. It might be that he lived a more real life within\\nhis thoughts, than amid the unappropriate environment of the\\nCollector’s office. The evolutions of the parade; the tumult of the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"battle; the flourish of old, heroic music, heard thirty years\\nbefore;—such scenes and sounds, perhaps, were all alive before his\\nintellectual sense. Meanwhile, the merchants and shipmasters, the\\nspruce clerks and uncouth sailors, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"entered and departed; the bustle of\\nthis commercial and custom-house life kept up its little murmur round\\nabout him; and neither with the men nor their affairs did the General\\nappear to sustain the most distant relation. He was as much out of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"place as an old sword—now rusty, but which had flashed once in the\\nbattle’s front, and showed still a bright gleam along its blade—would\\nhave been, among the inkstands, paper-folders, and mahogany rulers, on\\nthe Deputy Collector’s desk.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"There was one thing that much aided me in renewing and re-creating the\\nstalwart soldier of the Niagara frontier,—the man of true and simple\\nenergy.

If, in our\\ncountry, valor were rewarded by heraldic honor, this phrase—which it\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"seems so easy to speak, but which only he, with such a task of danger\\nand glory before him, has ever spoken—would be the best and fittest\\nof all mottoes for the General’s shield of arms.\\n\\nIt contributes greatly towards a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"man’s moral and intellectual health,\\nto be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike\\nhimself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and\\nabilities he must go out of himself to appreciate. The accidents of\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"my life have often afforded me this advantage, but never with more\\nfulness and variety than during my continuance in office. There was\\none man, especially, the observation of whose character gave me a new\\nidea of talent. His gifts were \"}]","[{\"text\":\"emphatically those of a man of\\nbusiness; prompt, acute, clear-minded; with an eye that saw through\\nall perplexities, and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish,\\nas by the waving of an enchanter’s wand.

In my contemplation, he stood \"}]","[{\"text\":\"as the ideal of his class. He\\nwas, indeed, the Custom-House in himself; or, at all events, the\\nmain-spring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion; for,\\nin an institution like this, where its officers are appointed to\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"subserve their own profit and convenience, and seldom with a leading\\nreference to their fitness for the duty to be performed, they must\\nperforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them. Thus, by\\nan inevitable necessity, as a magnet \"}]","[{\"text\":\"attracts steel-filings, so did\\nour man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody\\nmet with.

The merchants valued him\\nnot less than we, his esoteric friends.

A stain on his conscience, as to anything\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"that came within the range of his vocation, would trouble such a man\\nvery much in the same way, though to a far greater degree, that an\\nerror in the balance of an account or an ink-blot on the fair page of\\na book of record.

In truth, he was startled, if not\\nshocked, to find \"}]","[{\"text\":\"this attribute in the physician.

Not\\nthe less, however, though with a tremulous enjoyment, did he feel the\\noccasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of\\nanother kind of intellect than those with which he \"}]","[{\"text\":\"habitually held\\nconverse. It was as if a window were thrown open, admitting a freer\\natmosphere into the close and stifled study, where his life was\\nwasting itself away, amid lamplight, or obstructed day-beams, and the\\nmusty fragrance, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"be it sensual or moral, that exhales from books. But\\nthe air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort. So\\nthe minister, and the physician with him, withdrew again within the\\nlimits of what their church defined as orthodox.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"Thus Roger Chillingworth scrutinized his patient carefully, both as he\\nsaw him in his ordinary life, keeping an accustomed pathway in the\\nrange of thoughts familiar to him, and as he appeared when thrown\\namidst other moral scenery, the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"novelty of which might call out\\nsomething new to the surface of his character. He deemed it essential,\\nit would seem, to know the man, before attempting to do him good.\\nWherever there is a heart and an intellect, the diseases of the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these.

His\\nnerve seemed absolutely destroyed. His moral force was abased into\\nmore than childish weakness. It \"}]","[{\"text\":\"grovelled helpless on the ground, even\\nwhile his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength, or\\nhad perhaps acquired a morbid energy, which disease only could have\\ngiven them. With her knowledge of a train of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"circumstances hidden from\\nall others, she could readily infer that, besides the legitimate\\naction of his own conscience, a terrible machinery had been brought to\\nbear, and was still operating, on Mr. Dimmesdale’s well-being and\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"repose. Knowing what this poor, fallen man had once been, her whole\\nsoul was moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealed to\\nher,—the outcast woman,—for support against his instinctively\\ndiscovered enemy. She decided, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"moreover, that he had a right to her\\nutmost aid. Little accustomed, in her long seclusion from society, to\\nmeasure her ideas of right and wrong by any standard external to\\nherself, Hester saw—or seemed to see—that there lay a responsibility\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"upon her, in reference to the clergyman, which she owed to no other,\\nnor to the whole world besides. The links that united her to the rest\\nof human kind—links of flowers, or silk, or gold, or whatever the\\nmaterial—had all been broken. Here \"}]","[{\"text\":\"was the iron link of mutual crime,\\nwhich neither he nor she could break. Like all other ties, it brought\\nalong with it its obligations.\\n\\nHester Prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in which\\nwe beheld her \"}]","[{\"text\":\"during the earlier periods of her ignominy. Years had\\ncome and gone. Pearl was now seven years old. Her mother, with the\\nscarlet letter on her breast, glittering in its fantastic embroidery,\\nhad long been a familiar object to the towns-people. As \"}]","[{\"text\":\"is apt to be\\nthe case when a person stands out in any prominence before the\\ncommunity, and, at the same time, interferes neither with public nor\\nindividual interests and convenience, a species of general regard had\\nultimately grown \"}]","[{\"text\":\"up in reference to Hester Prynne. It is to the credit\\nof human nature, that, except where its selfishness is brought into\\nplay, it loves more readily than it hates. Hatred, by a gradual and\\nquiet process, will even be transformed to love, unless \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the change be\\nimpeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of\\nhostility. In this matter of Hester Prynne, there was neither\\nirritation nor irksomeness. She never battled with the public, but\\nsubmitted, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"uncomplainingly, to its worst usage; she made no claim upon\\nit, in requital for what she suffered; she did not weigh upon its\\nsympathies. Then, also, the blameless purity of her life during all\\nthese years in which she had been set \"}]","[{\"text\":\"apart to infamy, was reckoned\\nlargely in her favor. With nothing now to lose, in the sight of\\nmankind, and with no hope, and seemingly no wish, of gaining anything,\\nit could only be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"poor wanderer to its paths.\\n\\n[Illustration: Hester in the House of Mourning]\\n\\nIt was perceived, too, that while Hester never put forward even the\\nhumblest title to share in the world’s \"}]","[{\"text\":\"privileges,—further than to\\nbreathe the common air, and earn daily bread for little Pearl and\\nherself by the faithful labor of her hands,—she was quick to\\nacknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man, whenever benefits\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"were to be conferred.

In all seasons of calamity,\\nindeed, whether general or of individuals, the outcast of society at\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"once found her place. She came, not as a guest, but as a rightful\\ninmate, into the household that was darkened by trouble; as if its\\ngloomy twilight were a medium in which she was entitled to hold\\nintercourse with her \"}]","[{\"text\":\"fellow-creatures. There glimmered the embroidered\\nletter, with comfort in its unearthly ray. Elsewhere the token of sin,\\nit was the taper of the sick-chamber.

Hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her\\nhair, and confined them beneath her cap. As if there were a withering\\nspell in the sad letter, her beauty, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the warmth and richness of her\\nwomanhood, departed, like fading sunshine; and a gray shadow seemed to\\nfall across her.\\n\\nWhen the dreary change was wrought, she extended her hand to Pearl.\\n\\n“Dost thou know \"}]","[{\"text\":\"thy mother now, child?” asked she, reproachfully, but\\nwith a subdued tone. “Wilt thou come across the brook, and own thy\\nmother, now that she has her shame upon her,—now that she is sad?”\\n\\n“Yes; now I will!” answered the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"child, bounding across the brook, and\\nclasping Hester in her arms. “Now thou art my mother indeed! And I am\\nthy little Pearl!”\\n\\nIn a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her, she drew down her\\nmother’s head, and kissed her brow \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and both her cheeks. But then—by a\\nkind of necessity that always impelled this child to alloy whatever\\ncomfort she might chance to give with a throb of anguish—Pearl put up\\nher mouth, and kissed the scarlet letter too!\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"“That was not kind!” said Hester. “When thou hast shown me a little\\nlove, thou mockest me!”\\n\\n“Why doth the minister sit yonder?” asked Pearl.\\n\\n“He waits to welcome thee,” replied her mother. “Come \"}]","[{\"text\":\"thou, and\\nentreat his blessing!

It\\nwas only by an exertion of force that her mother brought her up to\\nhim, hanging back, and manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces; of\\nwhich, ever since \"}]","[{\"text\":\"her babyhood, she had possessed a singular variety,\\nand could transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different\\naspects, with a new mischief in them, each and all. The\\nminister—painfully embarrassed, but hoping that a kiss might prove a\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"talisman to admit him into the child’s kindlier regards—bent forward,\\nand impressed one on her brow. Hereupon, Pearl broke away from her\\nmother, and, running to the brook, stooped over it, and bathed her\\nforehead, until the unwelcome kiss \"}]","[{\"text\":\"was quite washed off, and diffused\\nthrough a long lapse of the gliding water. She then remained apart,\\nsilently watching Hester and the clergyman; while they talked\\ntogether, and made such arrangements as were suggested by their new\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"position, and the purposes soon to be fulfilled.\\n\\nAnd now this fateful interview had come to a close. The dell was to be\\nleft a solitude among its dark, old trees, which, with their\\nmultitudinous tongues, would whisper \"}]","[{\"text\":\"long of what had passed there,\\nand no mortal be the wiser. And the melancholy brook would add this\\nother tale to the mystery with which its little heart was already\\noverburdened, and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble, with\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"not a whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nXX.\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"THE MINISTER IN A MAZE.\\n\\n\\nAs the minister departed, in advance of Hester Prynne and little\\nPearl, he threw a backward glance; half expecting that he should\\ndiscover only some faintly traced \"}]","[{\"text\":\"features or outline of the mother\\nand the child, slowly fading into the twilight of the woods. So great\\na vicissitude in his life could not at once be received as real. But\\nthere was Hester, clad in her gray robe, still standing beside the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"tree-trunk, which some blast had overthrown a long antiquity ago, and\\nwhich time had ever since been covering with moss, so that these two\\nfated ones, with earth’s heaviest burden on them, might there sit down\\ntogether, and find a single hour’s \"}]","[{\"text\":\"rest and solace. And there was\\nPearl, too, lightly dancing from the margin of the brook,—now that\\nthe intrusive third person was gone,—and taking her old place by her\\nmother’s side. So the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed!\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"In order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of\\nimpression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he recalled and\\nmore thoroughly defined the plans which Hester and himself had\\nsketched for their departure. It had \"}]","[{\"text\":\"been determined between them,\\nthat the Old World, with its crowds and cities, offered them a more\\neligible shelter and concealment than the wilds of New England, or all\\nAmerica, with its alternatives of an Indian wigwam, or the few\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"settlements of Europeans, scattered thinly along the seaboard. Not to\\nspeak of the clergyman’s health, so inadequate to sustain the\\nhardships of a forest life, his native gifts, his culture, and his\\nentire development, would secure him \"}]","[{\"text\":\"a home only in the midst of\\ncivilization and refinement; the higher the state, the more delicately\\nadapted to it the man. In furtherance of this choice, it so happened\\nthat a ship lay in the harbor; one of those questionable cruisers,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"frequent at that day, which, without being absolutely outlaws of the\\ndeep, yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility\\nof character. This vessel had recently arrived from the Spanish Main,\\nand, within three days’ time, would \"}]","[{\"text\":\"sail for Bristol. Hester\\nPrynne—whose vocation, as a self-enlisted Sister of Charity, had\\nbrought her acquainted with the captain and crew—could take upon\\nherself to secure the passage of two individuals and a child, with all\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"the secrecy which circumstances rendered more than desirable.\\n\\nThe minister had inquired of Hester, with no little interest, the\\nprecise time at which the vessel might be expected to depart. It would\\nprobably be on the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"fourth day from the present. “That is most\\nfortunate!” he had then said to himself. Now, why the Reverend Mr.\\nDimmesdale considered it so very fortunate, we hesitate to reveal.\\nNevertheless,—to hold nothing back from the reader,—it \"}]","[{\"text\":\"was because,\\non the third day from the present, he was to preach the Election\\nSermon; and, as such an occasion formed an honorable epoch in the life\\nof a New England clergyman, he could not have chanced upon a more\\nsuitable mode and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"time of terminating his professional career. “At\\nleast, they shall say of me,” thought this exemplary man, “that I\\nleave no public duty unperformed, nor ill performed!” Sad, indeed,\\nthat an introspection so profound and acute as this poor \"}]","[{\"text\":\"minister’s\\nshould be so miserably deceived! We have had, and may still have,\\nworse things to tell of him; but none, we apprehend, so pitiably weak;\\nno evidence, at once so slight and irrefragable, of a subtle disease,\\nthat had long \"}]","[{\"text\":\"since begun to eat into the real substance of his\\ncharacter. No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to\\nhimself, and another to the multitude, without finally getting\\nbewildered as to which may be the true.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"The excitement of Mr. Dimmesdale’s feelings, as he returned from his\\ninterview with Hester, lent him unaccustomed physical energy, and\\nhurried him townward at a rapid pace. The pathway among the woods\\nseemed wilder, more uncouth with its \"}]","[{\"text\":\"rude natural obstacles, and less\\ntrodden by the foot of man, than he remembered it on his outward\\njourney. But he leaped across the plashy places, thrust himself\\nthrough the clinging underbrush, climbed the ascent, plunged into the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"hollow, and overcame, in short, all the difficulties of the track,\\nwith an unweariable activity that astonished him. He could not but\\nrecall how feebly, and with what frequent pauses for breath, he had\\ntoiled over the same ground, only two \"}]","[{\"text\":\"days before. As he drew near the\\ntown, he took an impression of change from the series of familiar\\nobjects that presented themselves. It seemed not yesterday, not one,\\nnor two, but many days, or even years ago, since he had quitted them.\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"There, indeed, was each former trace of the street, as he remembered\\nit, and all the peculiarities of the houses, with the due multitude\\nof gable-peaks, and a weathercock at every point where his memory\\nsuggested one. Not the less, however, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"came this importunately\\nobtrusive sense of change. The same was true as regarded the\\nacquaintances whom he met, and all the well-known shapes of human\\nlife, about the little town. They looked neither older nor younger\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"now; the beards of the aged were no whiter, nor could the creeping\\nbabe of yesterday walk on his feet to-day; it was impossible to\\ndescribe in what respect they differed from the individuals on whom he\\nhad so recently bestowed a parting \"}]","[{\"text\":\"glance; and yet the minister’s\\ndeepest sense seemed to inform him of their mutability. A similar\\nimpression struck him most remarkably, as he passed under the walls of\\nhis own church. The edifice had so very strange, and yet so familiar,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"an aspect, that Mr. Dimmesdale’s mind vibrated between two ideas;\\neither that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto, or that he was\\nmerely dreaming about it now.\\n\\nThis phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"indicated no\\nexternal change, but so sudden and important a change in the spectator\\nof the familiar scene, that the intervening space of a single day had\\noperated on his consciousness like the lapse of years. The minister’s\\nown will, and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Hester’s will, and the fate that grew between them, had\\nwrought this transformation. It was the same town as heretofore; but\\nthe same minister returned not from the forest. He might have said to\\nthe friends who greeted him,—“I am not the man for whom \"}]","[{\"text\":\"you take me!\\nI left him yonder in the forest, withdrawn into a secret dell, by a\\nmossy tree-trunk, and near a melancholy brook! Go, seek your minister,\\nand see if his emaciated figure, his thin cheek, his white, heavy,\\npain-wrinkled \"}]","[{\"text\":\"brow, be not flung down there, like a cast-off\\ngarment!” His friends, no doubt, would still have insisted with\\nhim,—“Thou art thyself the man!”—but the error would have been their\\nown, not his.\\n\\nBefore Mr. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Dimmesdale reached home, his inner man gave him other\\nevidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling. In\\ntruth, nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral code, in\\nthat interior kingdom, was adequate to account for the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"impulses now\\ncommunicated to the unfortunate and startled minister. At every step\\nhe was incited to do some strange, wild, wicked thing or other, with a\\nsense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional; in spite\\nof himself, yet \"}]","[{\"text\":\"growing out of a profounder self than that which\\nopposed the impulse. For instance, he met one of his own deacons. The\\ngood old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal\\nprivilege, which his venerable age, his upright and holy \"}]","[{\"text\":\"character,\\nand his station in the Church, entitled him to use; and, conjoined\\nwith this, the deep, almost worshipping respect, which the minister’s\\nprofessional and private claims alike demanded. Never was there a more\\nbeautiful example \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport\\nwith the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it, as from a lower\\nsocial rank, and inferior order of endowment, towards a higher. Now,\\nduring a conversation of some two or three moments \"}]","[{\"text\":\"between the\\nReverend Mr. Dimmesdale and this excellent and hoary-bearded deacon,\\nit was only by the most careful self-control that the former could\\nrefrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into\\nhis mind, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"respecting the communion supper. He absolutely trembled and\\nturned pale as ashes, lest his tongue should wag itself, in utterance\\nof these horrible matters, and plead his own consent for so doing,\\nwithout his having fairly given it. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"And, even with this terror in his\\nheart, he could hardly avoid laughing, to imagine how the sanctified\\nold patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his minister’s\\nimpiety!\\n\\nAgain, another incident of the same \"}]","[{\"text\":\"nature. Hurrying along the street,\\nthe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of\\nhis church; a most pious and exemplary old dame; poor, widowed,\\nlonely, and with a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"husband and children, and her dead friends of long ago, as a\\nburial-ground is full of storied gravestones. Yet all this, which\\nwould else have been such heavy sorrow, was made almost a solemn joy\\nto her devout old soul, by religious \"}]","[{\"text\":\"consolations and the truths of\\nScripture, wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than\\nthirty years. And, since Mr. Dimmesdale had taken her in charge, the\\ngood grandam’s chief earthly comfort—which, unless it had been\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"likewise a heavenly comfort, could have been none at all—was to meet\\nher pastor, whether casually, or of set purpose, and be refreshed with\\na word of warm, fragrant, heaven-breathing Gospel truth, from his\\nbeloved lips, into her dulled, but \"}]","[{\"text\":\"rapturously attentive ear. But, on\\nthis occasion, up to the moment of putting his lips to the old woman’s\\near, Mr. Dimmesdale, as the great enemy of souls would have it, could\\nrecall no text of Scripture, nor aught else, except a brief, pithy,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and, as it then appeared to him, unanswerable argument against the\\nimmortality of the human soul. The instilment thereof into her mind\\nwould probably have caused this aged sister to drop down dead, at\\nonce, as by the effect of an \"}]","[{\"text\":\"intensely poisonous infusion. What he\\nreally did whisper, the minister could never afterwards recollect.\\nThere was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder in his utterance, which\\nfailed to impart any distinct idea to the good widow’s comprehension,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"or which Providence interpreted after a method of its own. Assuredly,\\nas the minister looked back, he beheld an expression of divine\\ngratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine of the celestial city\\non her face, so wrinkled and ashy \"}]","[{\"text\":\"pale.\\n\\nAgain, a third instance. After parting from the old church-member, he\\nmet the youngest sister of them all. It was a maiden newly won—and\\nwon by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale’s own sermon, on the Sabbath after\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"his vigil—to barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the\\nheavenly hope, that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark\\naround her, and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory. She\\nwas fair and pure as a lily that had \"}]","[{\"text\":\"bloomed in Paradise. The minister\\nknew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity\\nof her heart, which hung its snowy curtains about his image, imparting\\nto religion the warmth of love, and to love a religious purity. Satan,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"that afternoon, had surely led the poor young girl away from her\\nmother’s side, and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted,\\nor—shall we not rather say?—this lost and desperate man. As she drew\\nnigh, the arch-fiend whispered him to \"}]","[{\"text\":\"condense into small compass and\\ndrop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to\\nblossom darkly soon, and bear black fruit betimes. Such was his sense\\nof power over this virgin soul, trusting him as she did, that the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"minister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one\\nwicked look, and develop all its opposite with but a word. So—with a\\nmightier struggle than he had yet sustained—he held his Geneva cloak\\nbefore his face, and hurried onward, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"making no sign of recognition,\\nand leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might. She\\nransacked her conscience,—which was full of harmless little matters,\\nlike her pocket or her work-bag,—and took herself to task, poor\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"thing! for a thousand imaginary faults; and went about her household\\nduties with swollen eyelids the next morning.\\n\\nBefore the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last\\ntemptation, he was conscious of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"another impulse, more ludicrous, and\\nalmost as horrible. It was,—we blush to tell it,—it was to stop\\nshort in the road, and teach some very wicked words to a knot of\\nlittle Puritan children who were playing there, and had but just begun\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"to talk. Denying himself this freak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met\\na drunken seaman, one of the ship’s crew from the Spanish Main. And,\\nhere, since he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness, poor\\nMr. Dimmesdale longed, at least, to \"}]","[{\"text\":\"shake hands with the tarry\\nblackguard, and recreate himself with a few improper jests, such as\\ndissolute sailors so abound with, and a volley of good, round, solid,\\nsatisfactory, and heaven-defying oaths! It was not so much a better\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"principle as partly his natural good taste, and still more his\\nbuckramed habit of clerical decorum, that carried him safely through\\nthe latter crisis.\\n\\n“What is it that haunts and tempts me thus?” cried the minister to\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"himself, at length, pausing in the street, and striking his hand\\nagainst his forehead. “Am I mad? or am I given over utterly to the\\nfiend? Did I make a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with\\nmy blood? And does he now summon me \"}]","[{\"text\":\"to its fulfilment, by suggesting\\nthe performance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination\\ncan conceive?”\\n\\nAt the moment when the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale thus communed with\\nhimself, and struck his forehead with \"}]","[{\"text\":\"his hand, old Mistress Hibbins,\\nthe reputed witch-lady, is said to have been passing by.

But she was brought back to her former mood by the\\nshimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and bright armor \"}]","[{\"text\":\"of the\\nmilitary company, which followed after the music, and formed the\\nhonorary escort of the procession. This body of soldiery—which still\\nsustains a corporate existence, and marches down from past ages with\\nan ancient and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"honorable fame—was composed of no mercenary materials.\\nIts ranks were filled with gentlemen, who felt the stirrings of\\nmartial impulse, and sought to establish a kind of College of Arms,\\nwhere, as in an association of Knights Templars, they \"}]","[{\"text\":\"might learn the\\nscience, and, so far as peaceful exercise would teach them, the\\npractices of war. The high estimation then placed upon the military\\ncharacter might be seen in the lofty port of each individual member\\nof the company. \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Some of them, indeed, by their services in the Low\\nCountries and on other fields of European warfare, had fairly won\\ntheir title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership. The entire\\narray, moreover, clad in burnished steel, and with \"}]","[{\"text\":\"plumage nodding\\nover their bright morions, had a brilliancy of effect which no modern\\ndisplay can aspire to equal.\\n\\nAnd yet the men of civil eminence, who came immediately behind the\\nmilitary escort, were better worth a \"}]","[{\"text\":\"thoughtful observer’s eye. Even\\nin outward demeanor, they showed a stamp of majesty that made the\\nwarrior’s haughty stride look vulgar, if not absurd. It was an age\\nwhen what we call talent had far less consideration than now, but the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"massive materials which produce stability and dignity of character a\\ngreat deal more.

In that old day, the\\nEnglish settler on these rude shores—having left king, nobles, and\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"all degrees of awful rank behind, while still the faculty and\\nnecessity of reverence were strong in him—bestowed it on the white\\nhair and venerable brow of age; on long-tried integrity; on solid\\nwisdom and sad-colored experience; on \"}]","[{\"text\":\"endowments of that grave and\\nweighty order which gives the idea of permanence, and comes under the\\ngeneral definition of respectability. These primitive statesmen,\\ntherefore,—Bradstreet, Endicott, Dudley, Bellingham, and their\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"compeers,—who were elevated to power by the early choice of the\\npeople, seem to have been not often brilliant, but distinguished by a\\nponderous sobriety, rather than activity of intellect. They had\\nfortitude and self-reliance, and, in \"}]","[{\"text\":\"time of difficulty or peril,\\nstood up for the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a\\ntempestuous tide. The traits of character here indicated were well\\nrepresented in the square cast of countenance and large physical\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"development of the new colonial magistrates. So far as a demeanor of\\nnatural authority was concerned, the mother country need not have been\\nashamed to see these foremost men of an actual democracy adopted into\\nthe House of Peers, or made the Privy \"}]","[{\"text\":\"Council of the sovereign.\\n\\nNext in order to the magistrates came the young and eminently\\ndistinguished divine, from whose lips the religious discourse of the\\nanniversary was expected. His was the profession, at \"}]","[{\"text\":\"that era, in\\nwhich intellectual ability displayed itself far more than in political\\nlife; for—leaving a higher motive out of the question—it offered\\ninducements powerful enough, in the almost worshipping respect of the\\ncommunity, to win \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the most aspiring ambition into its service. Even\\npolitical power—as in the case of Increase Mather—was within the\\ngrasp of a successful priest.\\n\\nIt was the observation of those who beheld him now, that never, since\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"Mr. Dimmesdale first set his foot on the New England shore, had he\\nexhibited such energy as was seen in the gait and air with which he\\nkept his pace in the procession.

The street and the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"market-place absolutely babbled, from side to side, with applauses of\\nthe minister.

According\\nto their united testimony, never had \"}]","[{\"text\":\"man spoken in so wise, so high,\\nand so holy a spirit, as he that spake this day; nor had inspiration\\never breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through\\nhis. Its influence could be seen, as it were, descending upon him, and\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"possessing him, and continually lifting him out of the written\\ndiscourse that lay before him, and filling him with ideas that must\\nhave been as marvellous to himself as to his audience. His subject, it\\nappeared, had been the relation \"}]","[{\"text\":\"between the Deity and the communities\\nof mankind, with a special reference to the New England which they\\nwere here planting in the wilderness. And, as he drew towards the\\nclose, a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him, constraining him to\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"its purpose as mightily as the old prophets of Israel were\\nconstrained; only with this difference, that, whereas the Jewish seers\\nhad denounced judgments and ruin on their country, it was his mission\\nto foretell a high and glorious \"}]","[{\"text\":\"destiny for the newly gathered people\\nof the Lord. But, throughout it all, and through the whole discourse,\\nthere had been a certain deep, sad undertone of pathos, which could\\nnot be interpreted otherwise than as the natural regret of one soon to\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"pass away. Yes; their minister whom they so loved—and who so loved\\nthem all, that he could not depart heavenward without a sigh—had the\\nforeboding of untimely death upon him, and would soon leave them in\\ntheir tears! This idea of his \"}]","[{\"text\":\"transitory stay on earth gave the last\\nemphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced; it was as if\\nan angel, in his passage to the skies, had shaken his bright wings\\nover the people for an instant,—at once a shadow and a\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"splendor,—and had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them.\\n\\nThus, there had come to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale—as to most men,\\nin their various spheres, though seldom recognized until they see it\\nfar behind them—an \"}]","[{\"text\":\"epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph\\nthan any previous one, or than any which could hereafter be.

The shout died into a murmur, as one portion of the crowd\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"after another obtained a glimpse of him. How feeble and pale he\\nlooked, amid all his triumph! The energy—or say, rather, the\\ninspiration which had held him up, until he should have delivered the\\nsacred message that brought its own \"}]","[{\"text\":\"strength along with it from\\nheaven—was withdrawn, now that it had so faithfully performed its\\noffice. The glow, which they had just before beheld burning on his\\ncheek, was extinguished, like a flame that sinks down hopelessly\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"among the late-decaying embers. It seemed hardly the face of a man\\nalive, with such a death-like hue; it was hardly a man with life in\\nhim, that tottered on his path so nervelessly, yet tottered, and did\\nnot fall!\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"One of his clerical brethren,—it was the venerable John\\nWilson,—observing the state in which Mr. Dimmesdale was left by the\\nretiring wave of intellect and sensibility, stepped forward hastily to\\noffer his support.

Others, again,—and those best able to appreciate\\nthe minister’s peculiar sensibility, and the wonderful operation of\\nhis spirit upon the body,—whispered their belief, that the awful\\nsymbol was the effect of the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"ever-active tooth of remorse, gnawing\\nfrom the inmost heart outwardly, and at last manifesting Heaven’s\\ndreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter. The reader\\nmay choose among these theories.

This unhappy man had made the very principle of\\nhis life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge;\\nand when, by its completest triumph and consummation, \"}]","[{\"text\":\"that evil\\nprinciple was left with no further material to support it, when, in\\nshort, there was no more Devil’s work on earth for him to do, it only\\nremained for the unhumanized mortal to betake himself whither his\\nMaster would find \"}]","[{\"text\":\"him tasks enough, and pay him his wages duly.
