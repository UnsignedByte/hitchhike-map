Then with a\\nmutual impulse the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s\\narms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted.

I’ll just _bet_ they will!”\\n\\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously\\nincreased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting\\nfountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues\\nfast enough to prevent an inundation; \"}]","[{\"text\":\"little overflowings down their\\nthroats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings\\nfollowed every time.

Both\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and\\nmain. Joe said feebly:\\n\\n“I’ve lost my knife.

You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring.\\nNo, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”\\n\\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour.

But something informed him that if they had\\nhad any trouble they had got rid of it.\\n\\nThey were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare\\ntheirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well—something they ate\\nat dinner had disagreed with them.\\n\\nAbout midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"a brooding\\noppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys\\nhuddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of\\nthe fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was\\nstifling. They sat \"}]","[{\"text\":\"still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.\\nBeyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the\\nblackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that\\nvaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then \"}]","[{\"text\":\"vanished. By and by\\nanother came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came\\nsighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting\\nbreath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned\\nnight into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and\\ndistinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,\\nstartled faces, too. A deep peal of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"thunder went rolling and tumbling\\ndown the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A\\nsweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the\\nflaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops\\nright over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick\\ngloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.\\n\\n“Quick! boys, go \"}]","[{\"text\":\"for the tent!” exclaimed Tom.\\n\\nThey sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no\\ntwo plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through\\nthe trees, making everything sing as it went. One \"}]","[{\"text\":\"blinding flash after\\nanother came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching\\nrain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the\\nground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one\\nthey straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,\\nand streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something\\nto be grateful for.

The tempest\\nrose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its\\nfastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"others’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter\\nof a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its\\nhighest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed\\nin the skies, everything below stood \"}]","[{\"text\":\"out in cleancut and shadowless\\ndistinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the\\ndriving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on\\nthe other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight\\nand fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging\\nthunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,\\nand unspeakably appalling. The storm \"}]","[{\"text\":\"culminated in one matchless effort\\nthat seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to\\nthe treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one\\nand the same moment.

The\\nboys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter\\nof their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were\\nnot under it when the catastrophe happened.\\n\\nEverything in camp was drenched, the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"campfire as well; for they were but\\nheedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against\\nrain.

Then they\\npiled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were\\ngladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their\\nmidnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep\\non, anywhere around.\\n\\nAs the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness \"}]","[{\"text\":\"came over\\nthem, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got\\nscorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After\\nthe meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once\\nmore. Tom saw the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as\\nhe could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or\\nanything.

There was no other\\nprocess that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished\\nthey had remained \"}]","[{\"text\":\"pirates.

The day was completed and crowned in\\na peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint\\nthe next day for the long-promised \"}]","[{\"text\":\"and long-delayed picnic, and she\\nconsented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more\\nmoderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway\\nthe young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"and pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep\\nawake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s\\n“maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers\\nwith, next day; but he was \"}]","[{\"text\":\"disappointed. No signal came that night.\\n\\nMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and\\nrollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was\\nready for a start. It was not the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"custom for elderly people to mar the\\npicnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough\\nunder the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young\\ngentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main\\nstreet laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss\\nthe fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.\\nThatcher said to Becky, was:\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with\\nsome of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”\\n\\n“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”\\n\\n“Very well. And \"}]","[{\"text\":\"mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”\\n\\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\\n\\n“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll\\nclimb right up the hill and stop at \"}]","[{\"text\":\"the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have\\nice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be\\nawful glad to have us.”\\n\\n“Oh, that will be fun!”\\n\\nThen Becky reflected a moment and \"}]","[{\"text\":\"said:\\n\\n“But what will mamma say?”\\n\\n“How’ll she ever know?”\\n\\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\\n\\n“I reckon it’s \"}]","[{\"text\":\"wrong—but—”\\n\\n“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she\\nwants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if\\nshe’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”\\n\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"The Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and\\nTom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say\\nnothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to\\nTom that maybe Huck might come this \"}]","[{\"text\":\"very night and give the signal. The\\nthought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he\\ncould not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he\\ngive it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so\\n\"}]","[{\"text\":\"why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the\\nevening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined\\nto yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of\\nthe box of money another time that \"}]","[{\"text\":\"day.\\n\\nThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody\\nhollow and tied up.

He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not\\nstop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his\\nattention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten\\no’clock came, and the noise of \"}]","[{\"text\":\"vehicles ceased, scattered lights began\\nto wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village\\nbetook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the\\nsilence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock came, and the \"}]","[{\"text\":\"tavern lights were\\nput out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long\\ntime, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening.
